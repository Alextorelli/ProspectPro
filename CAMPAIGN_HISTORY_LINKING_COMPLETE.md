- **Campaign Loading**: Automatically loads specific campaigns from dashboard history
- **Error Handling**: Redirects to discovery page if campaign not found
- **Navigation Integration**: Seamless linking from dashboard to campaign details

### ✅ Enhanced Data Model

### Data Flow

```
Dashboard → Click Campaign → Navigate to /campaign?id=CAMPAIGN_ID → Load Campaign → Filter Leads → Display Results + CSV Export
```

### URL Structure

- **Dashboard**: `/dashboard` - Shows all campaign history
- **Specific Campaign**: `/campaign?id=CAMPAIGN_ID` - Shows individual campaign details
- **Discovery**: `/discovery` - Start new campaigns

## User Workflow

### From Dashboard

1. View campaign history with business context (type + location)
2. Click any campaign card or "View Details →" button
3. Navigate to campaign-specific results page
4. Review results and download CSV again with same tier-specific columns

### Direct Access

1. Use direct URL `/campaign?id=CAMPAIGN_ID` for bookmarking
2. Share specific campaign results with team members
3. Access historical campaigns via browser history

### CSV Re-download

1. Access any past campaign from dashboard
2. View original results table with confidence scores
3. Download CSV with same tier-specific columns as original export
4. Includes ownership data columns for Compliance tier campaigns
