# üöÄ Enhanced Database Deployment Guide

## Database Issue Resolution

The script error occurred because your Supabase database doesn't have the enhanced schema deployed yet. The enhanced integrations require the new database structure with Row Level Security (RLS) enabled.

## Step 1: Deploy Enhanced Schema to Supabase

1. **Log in to your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your ProspectPro project

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Navigate to "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New query"

3. **Deploy the Enhanced Schema**
   - Copy the entire contents of `database/enhanced-supabase-schema.sql`
   - Paste into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute the schema

## Step 2: Verify Schema Deployment

Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor to verify tables were created:

```sql
-- Check if enhanced tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN (
  'enhanced_leads',
  'campaigns', 
  'lead_emails',
  'lead_social_profiles',
  'api_usage_log'
);
```

You should see all 5 tables listed.

## Step 3: Enable Row Level Security

The schema includes RLS policies, but verify they're active:

```sql
-- Check RLS status
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN ('enhanced_leads', 'campaigns', 'lead_emails', 'lead_social_profiles', 'api_usage_log');
```

All tables should show `rowsecurity = true`.

## Step 4: Test Database Connection

Run this test to verify your enhanced database is working:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\Alext\OneDrive\Documents\Personal\Projects\Appsmithery\ProspectPro\ProspectPro_REBUILD"
node -e "
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
const client = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);
client.from('campaigns').select('*').limit(1).then(res => {
  console.log('‚úÖ Database connection successful');
  console.log('Schema status:', res.error ? '‚ùå Schema missing' : '‚úÖ Schema deployed');
}).catch(err => console.error('‚ùå Connection failed:', err.message));
"
```

## Step 5: Re-run Enhanced Integration Tests

Once the schema is deployed, re-run the tests:

```bash
node test/test-enhanced-integrations.js
```

## Expected Results After Schema Deployment

### ‚úÖ ScrapingDog Integration
- Multi-radius search working
- Cost tracking operational
- Budget management active

### ‚úÖ Hunter.io Integration  
- Email pattern generation working
- Domain search functional
- Usage tracking enabled

### ‚úÖ Supabase Integration
- Database operations successful
- Real-time subscriptions active
- Analytics functions working

### ‚úÖ Lead Discovery Orchestrator
- End-to-end workflow operational
- Campaign creation successful
- Quality scoring functional

## Troubleshooting

### If schema deployment fails:
1. Check if you have sufficient permissions in Supabase
2. Try running the schema in smaller chunks
3. Verify your project isn't on a restricted plan

### If RLS errors persist:
1. Ensure you're authenticated with Supabase
2. Check that your user has proper permissions
3. Verify the RLS policies match your user context

### If API calls still fail:
1. Verify all environment variables in `.env`
2. Check API key quotas and billing status
3. Review network/firewall restrictions

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. **Configure Production Environment Variables** (25 total required)
2. **Deploy to Railway** with enhanced configuration
3. **Set up real-time monitoring dashboard**
4. **Configure budget alerts and limits**
5. **Run first production lead discovery campaign**

The enhanced integrations provide a premium lead generation platform with:
- ‚úÖ Real API integrations (no fake data)
- ‚úÖ Cost optimization and budget controls
- ‚úÖ Quality scoring and validation
- ‚úÖ Real-time monitoring and analytics
- ‚úÖ Production-ready security (RLS enabled)
