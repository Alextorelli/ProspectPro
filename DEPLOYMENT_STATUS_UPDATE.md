# Deployment Status Update - September 26, 2025

## Issue Resolution

### Root Cause

- Service account `prospectpro-deployment@leadgen-471822.iam.gserviceaccount.com` lacks required IAM roles
- GitHub Actions workflow is properly configured
- All secrets are confirmed set in GitHub repository

### Required Actions

1. **Fix Service Account Permissions** (Google Cloud Console)

   - Add 5 critical IAM roles to deployment service account
   - See `fix-deployment.js` for complete instructions

2. **Trigger Deployment**
   - Automatic via GitHub Actions on push to main
   - Manual trigger available in GitHub Actions tab

### Status

- ❌ Service account permissions (blocking deployment)
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow configured
- ✅ Repository secrets configured
- ✅ Supabase integration ready (OAuth disabled)
- ✅ Application code production-ready

### Next Steps

1. Execute permission fixes in Google Cloud Console
2. Push this update to trigger deployment
3. Monitor deployment via GitHub Actions
4. Test production endpoints post-deployment

### Expected Resolution Time

- 5 minutes for permission fixes
- 3-4 minutes for automated deployment
- Total: ~10 minutes to production deployment
