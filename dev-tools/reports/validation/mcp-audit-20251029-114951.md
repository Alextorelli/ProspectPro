## Deprecated Artifacts
- [ ] observability-server.js (superseded by client-service-layer telemetry)
- [ ] tool-reference.md (manual doc, should be auto-generated)
- [ ] MCP-package.json (redundant with package.json)
- [ ] test-results.json (stale, should use dev-tools/reports/)

## Consolidation Targets
- Utility server: Keep as canonical `utility-server/`
- Environments: Keep development.js, production.js; archive troubleshooting.js
- Package locks: Single canonical lock per package
