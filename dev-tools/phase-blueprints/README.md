| 01    | Baseline alignment        | Regenerated agent configs, MCP tooling parity, unified startup tasks |
| 02    | Context + workflow engine | Redis-backed context store, event bus, orchestration tests           |
| 03    | Observability stack       | OTel → Jaeger → Prometheus automation with diagnostics tasks         |
| 04    | Validation orchestration  | MCP-aware validation runner, CI wiring, zero fake data gates         |
| 05    | Documentation + QA        | Regenerated docs, dashboards, release artifact checklist             |
