# Context Store Migration Coverage Log

## 2025-10-27

- Migrated agent context files to flat layout: development-workflow.json, observability.json, production-ops.json, system-architect.json
- Updated context-manager.ts and EnvironmentContextManager to use new flat file and environment context locations
- Added README.md to /store and /store/agents to document migration and deprecation
- Created shared/environments/ for environment context files
- Confirmed legacy per-agent folders are now empty except for context.json (pending removal)
- No data loss observed; all agent state preserved
- Next: update documentation, schemas, and automation scripts to match new structure
