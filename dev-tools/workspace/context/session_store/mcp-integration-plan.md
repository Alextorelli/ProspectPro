# MCP Integration Worklog — Sequential Thinking & Memory Servers

_Date: 2025-10-26_

## Phase 1 — Baseline Audit

- Capture current registry (`dev-tools/agents/mcp-servers/active-registry.json`) and cross-check against `mcp.json` inputs
- Inspect existing sequential and memory MCP tool directories for drift vs upstream packages
- Inventory outstanding workspace scratch artifacts and clean session store

## Phase 2 — Package Realignment

- Rehydrate package manifests (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`) and ensure build/test scripts match ProspectPro Node 20 target
- Restore canonical source files (`index.ts`, `lib.ts`, `README.md`) for both packages with ProspectPro-specific defaults
- Introduce context path environment toggles for session persistence

## Phase 3 — Context Management Strategy

- Default memory JSONL storage to `dev-tools/agents/context/session_store/memory.jsonl`
- Default sequential thought ledger to `dev-tools/agents/context/session_store/sequential-thoughts.jsonl`
- Document overrides via `MCP_MEMORY_FILE_PATH` and `SEQUENTIAL_LOG_PATH`


## Phase 4 — Validation & Registry Sync (Complete)

- Compile TypeScript outputs (`npm run build`) for both packages  ✅
- Update `active-registry.json` and `tool-reference.md` if tool signatures change  ✅
- Smoke test sequential + memory servers locally using direct node invocation with session store paths  ✅

**2025-10-26 Completion Note:**
Artifact/lock file policy enforced (.gitignore excludes dist/, package-lock.json tracked). MCP Sequential and Memory servers rebuilt and smoke-tested with session-store log paths. Phase 4 complete; ready for documentation refresh and Phase 5 handoff.

## Phase 5 — Documentation & Handoff

- Refresh `dev-tools/agents/mcp-servers/README.md` and package-level READMEs with new defaults
- Note plan completion in `coverage.md` once merged

---

**2025-10-27 Status Notes:** Phases 2–4 executed locally via `npm run build:tools`. Registry and documentation were updated alongside session-store defaults. Pending follow-up: capture smoke-test transcripts after the next MCP workflow run.
