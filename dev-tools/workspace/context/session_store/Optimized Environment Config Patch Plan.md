# Monitoring & Testing Consolidation Plan (2025-10-29)

## Current Snapshot vs Target State

| Area                        | Current state                                                                                                                                                                           | To-be (streamlined)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Highlight observability** | Frontend loads browser SDK; backend/dev-tools emit only Supabase/MCP logs. No full-stack correlation.                                                                                   | Add `dev-tools/observability/highlight-node/` wrapping `@highlight-run/node` (per Highlight Node docs). Single initializer exposes `initHighlightNode()` plus middleware/utilities so server code, agents, and Supabase functions can forward traces. Frontend keeps existing browser bootstrapping, referencing the new helper for cross-linking. Fallback to noop when credentials are absent. |
| **Telemetry storage**       | Artifacts scattered (browser Highlight, Supabase logs, ad-hoc reports).                                                                                                                 | Persist long-lived telemetry and coverage under `dev-tools/reports/` with subfolders for Highlight payload mirrors, Playwright traces, and Vitest coverage. Record environment wiring and any exceptions in `docs/tooling/settings-staging.md` prior to enabling new pipelines.                                                                                                                  |
| **Testing tools**           | Vitest (frontend only), Playwright (single spec), Deno harness (edge functions), manual React DevTools workflow. Entry points spread across npm scripts and large `.vscode/tasks.json`. | Standardise on Vitest + Playwright + Deno. Relocate suites to `dev-tools/testing/agents/<agent>/{unit,integration,e2e}` and use `tests/smoke/` for cross-app Playwright. Retire the standalone React DevTools workflow or wrap it as an optional Taskfile goal.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Automation**              | Mixed npm scripts and VS Code tasks with no agent-level orchestration.                                                                                                                  | Introduce `dev-tools/testing/Taskfile.yml` and per-agent Taskfiles powering `task agents:test:{unit,integration,e2e,full}`. Provide a thin npm shim (`"test:agents": "task -d dev-tools/testing agents:test:full"`) and, once staged, point VS Code tasks at the Taskfile runners.                                                                                                               |
| **Configs**                 | Single Vitest config (`app/frontend/vitest.config.ts`) and root `playwright.config.ts` hard-coded to localhost.                                                                         | Add `dev-tools/testing/configs/vitest.agents.config.ts` (Node environment, shared setup) and `dev-tools/testing/configs/playwright.agents.config.ts` (per-agent `testDir`, reporters, `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` env override). Limit the root Vite config to frontend projects only.                                                                                                                 |
| **Setup utilities**         | `dev-tools/testing/utils/setup.ts` is an empty stub.                                                                                                                                    | Expand setup with deterministic fixtures and Supabase test stubs (no service-role secrets), and optionally call the shared Highlight Node helper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Governance**              | Manual inventory updates after ad-hoc changes.                                                                                                                                          | After restructuring, refresh `session_store/*-filetree.txt`, append provenance notes to `coverage.md`, run `npm run docs:update`, and stage all `.vscode` or CI changes via `docs/tooling/settings-staging.md`.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Implementation Blueprint

1. **Highlight Node wrapper**

- Create `dev-tools/observability/highlight-node/` with:
  - `index.ts` exporting `initHighlightNode`, request/edge helper hooks, and a noop fallback when Highlight env vars are missing.
  - A README referencing Highlight docs (`/docs/sdk/nodejs`, `/docs/getting-started/server/js/nodejs`, `/docs/getting-started/frontend-backend-mapping`).
  - Optional adapters for Express/Fastify-like handlers to ease reuse across agents and Supabase edge functions.
- Update backend functions and future agent services to consume the wrapper instead of embedding SDK logic per codepath.

2. **Taskfile hierarchy**

- Add `dev-tools/testing/Taskfile.yml` defining `agents:test:{unit,integration,e2e,full}`, lint shortcuts, and report consolidation.
- Place per-agent Taskfiles beside the suites (`dev-tools/testing/agents/<agent>/Taskfile.yml`) to expose focused targets such as `task unit`, `task e2e`, and `task debug:e2e`.
- Provide an npm shim (`"test:agents": "task -d dev-tools/testing agents:test:full"`) and, once vetted, update VS Code task entries to invoke `task` commands instead of bespoke scripts.

3. **Testing configs**

- Create `dev-tools/testing/configs/vitest.agents.config.ts` using the Node environment, shared setup file, coverage output under `dev-tools/testing/reports/coverage/`, and path aliases for agent fixtures.
- Create `dev-tools/testing/configs/playwright.agents.config.ts` delegating to `@playwright/test` with per-agent `testDir`, JSON/HTML reporters stored under `dev-tools/testing/reports/playwright/`, and `baseURL` derived from `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` (fallback staging URL).
- Trim the root `vite.config.ts` so the frontend project points at `app/frontend/vitest.config.ts` only.

4. **Suite relocation**

- Move agent Vitest and Playwright specs into `dev-tools/testing/agents/<agent>/{unit,integration,playwright}` and centralise fixtures in `dev-tools/testing/utils/fixtures/`.
- Keep `tests/` for Playwright smoke packs (e.g., high-level auth/campaign/export flows) and document this scope in `tests/README.md`.
- Flesh out `dev-tools/testing/utils/setup.ts` with deterministic seeding helpers and conditional Highlight node bootstrapping.

5. **Editor & automation alignment**

- Stage updates to `.vscode/tasks.json` and `.vscode/launch.json` so Task Explorer and debugging flows call the new Taskfile recipes rather than custom scripts.
- Note the adjustments in `docs/tooling/settings-staging.md` before merging, and keep extensions (Vitest, Playwright) in auto-detect mode for project discovery.

6. **Inventory & documentation hygiene**

- After moving files, refresh `dev-tools/workspace/context/session_store/app-filetree.txt` and `dev-tools-filetree.txt` and log the restructuring in `dev-tools/workspace/context/session_store/coverage.md`.
- Run `npm run docs:update` to regenerate indices (CODEBASE_INDEX, SYSTEM_REFERENCE) that reference testing assets or new observability utilities.
- Record any monitoring endpoint updates (e.g., staging Highlight OTLP or Jaeger URLs) in `docs/tooling/settings-staging.md` alongside the Highlight node rollout.

## Supporting Notes

- **Existing monitoring**: The React app already initialises Highlight’s browser SDK; staging and production configs reference shared OTLP endpoints. Supabase edge functions emit structured logs, and the MCP log forwarder captures automation telemetry into `dev-tools/reports/`.
- **Testing trio**: Vitest covers frontend utilities, Playwright drives UI smoke tests, and the Deno harness validates Supabase edge functions under `app/backend/functions/tests/`. The new structure keeps this minimal toolset while improving discoverability and automation.
- **VS Code workflows**: Test Explorer already surfaces Vitest and Playwright via installed extensions; once Taskfiles are registered, agents can trigger domain-specific runs directly from VS Code without switching to bespoke npm scripts.
- **Highlight goal**: Implementing the node wrapper enables full-stack session mapping per Highlight’s guidance while avoiding duplicated `H.init` calls across services.
- **Governance reminder**: No `.vscode` or `.github` changes should bypass `docs/tooling/settings-staging.md`, and all telemetry endpoint adjustments must be tracked for observability audits.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Scaffold the Highlight Node helper package with documentation links and noop fallback.
2. Author the root and per-agent Taskfiles, plus the supporting npm shim.
3. Commit Vitest/Playwright configuration wrappers and update `vite.config.ts` accordingly.
4. Relocate existing specs/fixtures into the new agent-aware layout and enrich `setup.ts`.
5. Stage editor/CI updates through `docs/tooling/settings-staging.md`, refresh inventories, and regenerate documentation indices.
6. Validate the flow by running `task agents:test:full` (or the npm shim) and confirm telemetry artifacts land in `dev-tools/testing/reports/`.

## Monitoring Endpoint Validation (2025-10-28)

**Production:**

- otelEndpoint: `https://otel.prospectpro.app/v1/traces` (cloud, correct)
- jaegerUrl: `https://jaeger.prospectpro.app` (cloud, correct)
- logDashboard: Supabase project dashboard (correct)

**Staging:**

- otelEndpoint: `http://localhost:4318/v1/traces` (**local only, not cloud-accessible**)
- jaegerUrl: `http://localhost:16686` (**local only, not cloud-accessible**)
- logDashboard: Supabase project dashboard (OK)

**Development:**

- otelEndpoint: `http://localhost:4318/v1/traces` (local, expected for dev)
- jaegerUrl: `http://localhost:16686` (local, expected for dev)
- logDashboard: `http://localhost:3000/logs` (local, expected for dev)

### Remediation Recommendations

- [ ] Update staging otelEndpoint and jaegerUrl to use shared or cloud observability endpoints for integration testing and remote trace visibility.
- [ ] Document any exceptions or temporary local endpoints in `docs/tooling/settings-staging.md`.
- [ ] Confirm production endpoints remain stable and cloud-accessible.

**Next:** Propose patch for staging monitoring URLs, or coordinate with observability team to provision shared endpoints.

# Optimized Environment Config Patch Strategy

## Validation Summary

**Current state:**

- ✅ development.json - localhost URLs correct
- ✅ production.json - production URLs current
- ❌ staging.json - outdated Vercel URL + misnamed as "troubleshooting"

**Required changes:**

1. Update staging.json deployment URL to new alias
2. Rename environment from "troubleshooting" to "staging" for consistency
3. Align feature flags with staging purpose (enable async discovery for realistic testing)
4. Ensure environment secrets align with canonical agent tooling `.env.agent.local` (Supabase, Highlight, Vercel tokens)
5. Confirm production references the stable custom domain `https://prospectpro.appsmithery.co`
6. Verify monitoring endpoints (Highlight.io, Jaeger, Supabase logs) for each environment remain accurate
7. Validate staging alias automation via Vercel CLI and preview deployments

### Preflight Validation Checklist

- [ ] Export/confirm `.env` variables used by agents/MCPs (`dev-tools/agents/.env.agent.local`) match environment config keys (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `HIGHLIGHT_PROJECT_ID`, etc.).
- [ ] Production: confirm monitoring endpoints point to Highlight.io dashboards, React DevTools overlays, and Supabase log dashboards.
- [ ] Development: verify Supabase project reference and anon key placeholders are correct; update before running automation if real keys exist.
- [ ] Staging: run `npm run env:pull -- --environment=preview` and `npx --yes vercel@latest alias ls` to ensure preview deployments are aliased to `staging.prospectpro.appsmithery.co`.
- [ ] Validate staging telemetry endpoints (Highlight OTLP, Jaeger URLs) accept inbound traces; update to shared observability endpoints if required.
- [ ] Document any discrepancies or exceptions in `docs/tooling/settings-staging.md` before applying patches.

## Key Improvements Over Original Plan

1. **Comprehensive updates**: Not just URL—also fixed environment name, feature flags, and permissions for proper staging behavior
2. **Automated validation**: Script includes JSON validation and context checks before completion
3. **Bidirectional logging**: Updates both coverage.md (provenance) and settings-staging.md (configuration audit trail)
4. **Atomic operation**: Single script execution with rollback-friendly temp file pattern
5. **Alignment with workflow**: Matches the staging alias deployment scripts (`deploy:staging:alias`) already in place
