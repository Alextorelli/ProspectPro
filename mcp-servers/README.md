## Quick Start

```bash
# Start production monitoring
npm run start:production

# Start development server
npm run start:development

# Start troubleshooting server (for debugging deployment issues)
npm run start:troubleshooting

# Start all servers
npm run start:all

# Test all servers
npm run test
```

## ðŸš¨ Quick Troubleshooting (NEW in v3.0)

### Frontend Shows "Discovery Failed" or "API request failed: 404"

**IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSIS** with MCP Troubleshooting Server:

```bash
npm run start:troubleshooting
```

In your AI assistant, use these MCP tools in systematic order:

1. `test_edge_function` - Verify backend works independently of frontend
2. `diagnose_anon_key_mismatch` - Check for authentication sync issues (90% of problems)
3. `validate_database_permissions` - Verify RLS policies are configured correctly
4. `check_vercel_deployment` - Validate frontend deployment status
5. `generate_debugging_commands` - Get custom debugging scripts for your config

**Manual Quick Test** (if MCP not available):

```bash
# Test Edge Function directly (bypasses frontend completely)
curl -X POST 'https://sriycekxdqnesdsgwiuc.supabase.co/functions/v1/business-discovery' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CURRENT_ANON_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"businessType": "test", "location": "test"}'
```

**Expected Results**: Real business data response = backend working, frontend issue  
**If 401 error**: Authentication or RLS policy issue

### 3. VS Code Configuration

The consolidated MCP configuration is automatically set up in `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp.enable": true,
  "mcp.servers": {
    "prospectpro-production": {
      "enabled": true,
      "autoStart": true,
      "description": "Enhanced Production Server - 28 tools"
    },
    "prospectpro-development": {
      "enabled": true,
      "autoStart": false,
      "description": "Development Server - 8 specialized tools"
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Environment Requirements

Consolidated servers require the same environment variables as the main application:

- `SUPABASE_URL`: Database connection
- `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`: Database access
- API keys for external services (Google Places, Hunter.io, NeverBounce, Foursquare)
- Development server requires additional API keys for new integrations (US Chamber, BBB, etc.)

## Usage Examples

### Database Queries via AI

```
"Show me the top 10 leads with confidence scores above 85"
"Analyze lead quality patterns for restaurants in New York"
"What are the API costs for the last 24 hours?"
```

### API Testing via AI

```
"Test the Google Places API with a search for 'coffee shops in Seattle'"
"Simulate lead discovery for 'restaurants' in 'San Francisco'"
"Verify the email address john@example.com"
```

### Codebase Analysis via AI

```
"Analyze the project structure and identify key components"
"Check for any fake data generation patterns in the code"
"Find all error handling patterns in API clients"
```

### System Monitoring via AI

```
"Check the overall system health status"
"Analyze recent application logs for errors"
"Generate a performance report with recommendations"
```

## Advanced AI Workflows

### 1. Lead Quality Analysis

AI can now directly query your database to provide insights like:

- "Which business types have the highest confidence scores?"
- "What's the correlation between email confidence and overall lead quality?"
- "Show me leads that failed validation and why"

### 2. API Cost Optimization

AI can analyze your API usage patterns:

- "Which APIs are costing the most money?"
- "Are we approaching any quota limits?"
- "Suggest optimizations to reduce API costs"

### 3. Code Quality Assurance

AI can continuously monitor code quality:

- "Are there any patterns that could lead to fake data generation?"
- "Analyze error handling coverage across all modules"
- "Check if all API clients follow the same patterns"

### 4. System Performance Monitoring

AI can provide system insights:

- "Is the system performing optimally?"
- "What are the largest files that might be slowing down development?"
- "Are there any configuration issues that need attention?"

## Consolidated MCP Server Management

### Consolidated Server Commands

```bash
# Start production server (28 tools - auto-starts with VS Code)
npm run start:production

# Start development server (8 tools - manual start)
npm run start:development

# Start both servers for comprehensive development
npm run start:all
```

### Server Status Monitoring

```bash
# Test both consolidated servers
npm run test

# Check detailed test results and performance metrics
cat test-results.json

# Validate specific server capabilities
node -e "console.log(require('./production-server.js').tools.length + ' production tools')"
node -e "console.log(require('./development-server.js').tools.length + ' development tools')"
```

### Performance Benefits

**Consolidation Results**:

- **Servers**: 5 â†’ 2 (60% reduction)
- **Memory Usage**: ~40% reduction in MCP processes
- **Startup Time**: ~50% faster initialization
- **Tools Available**: 36 total (100% preservation)
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive validation suite

## Security Considerations

### Data Access Control

- MCP servers use the same authentication as the main application
- Database access is limited to read-only operations where appropriate
- API keys are passed through environment variables only

### AI Context Boundaries

- MCP servers provide structured access to prevent unauthorized operations
- Each server has defined capabilities and cannot exceed its scope
- Error handling prevents sensitive information leakage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MCP Servers Not Starting**

   - Check dependencies: `npm run mcp:install`
   - Verify environment variables are set
   - Run tests: `npm run mcp:test`

2. **VS Code Not Recognizing MCP**

   - Restart VS Code after configuration changes
   - Check `.vscode/mcp-config.json` syntax
   - Verify MCP is enabled in settings

3. **Database Connection Issues**

   - Check Supabase credentials
   - Verify database server status
   - Run diagnostics: `curl http://localhost:3000/diag`

4. **API Testing Failures**
   - Verify API keys are configured
   - Check API quota limits
   - Test individual APIs outside MCP first

## Development Notes

### Adding New MCP Tools

1. Add tool definition to the server's `tools/list` handler
2. Implement tool execution in `tools/call` handler
3. Update this documentation
4. Add tests to `test-servers.js`

### Best Practices

- Keep tools focused on specific functionality
- Provide detailed error messages
- Include usage examples in tool descriptions
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Cache expensive operations where appropriate

## Migration from v1.0 (Individual Servers)
