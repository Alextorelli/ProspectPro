## Usage

```bash
# Open in dev container
code --folder-uri vscode-remote://dev-container+ProspectPro/workspace

# Container will automatically:
# 1. Install all dependencies
# 2. Apply Vira Deepforest theme
# 3. Configure MCP servers
# 4. Set up API testing tools
# 5. Display ready message
```

## Theme Customization

To modify the development theme, edit:

- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` - Container-wide settings
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer-workspace.code-workspace` - Workspace-specific customizations

The theme helps maintain visual separation between:

- Development work (green/forest theme)
- Testing environments (can be configured differently)
- Production environments (typically more neutral themes)

This visual organization reduces context switching mental overhead and helps maintain focus during intensive API integration work.
