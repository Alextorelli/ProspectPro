## Development vs. Production Language Issues Identified

### ðŸš¨ Critical Dev/Prod Language Inconsistencies Found:

#### 1. **Documentation References**

- `production-simulation.js` header states "Production Simulation" but contains simulated data
- `West-Coast-SMB-Campaign-Results.md` labeled as "Production Results" but based on simulation
- Mixed messaging between "simulation" and "production" throughout traces

#### 2. **Environment Variable Usage**

- `NODE_ENV=development` references in server traces
- `SKIP_AUTH_IN_DEV=true` development bypass mechanisms active
- No clear production environment configuration documented

#### 3. **API Endpoint Terminology**

- Development server references in logs: `development server`, `env=development`
- Authentication bypass using development flags rather than production tokens
- Health check endpoints mixing dev/prod language

### ðŸ”§ Immediate Fixes Required:

1. **Clear Production vs. Simulation Naming**

   - Rename files to clearly indicate simulation vs. production testing
   - Update all documentation to distinguish between simulated and live API results
   - Implement separate production configuration files

2. **Environment Configuration Standardization**
   - Create production-specific environment variable documentation
   - Remove development bypass mechanisms from production codebase
   - Implement proper production authentication flow
