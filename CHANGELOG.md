- **Global Edge Deployment**: Functions run in 18+ regions with <100ms cold starts
- **Enhanced Quality Scoring v3.0**: Cost-efficient validation pipeline integrated into Edge Functions
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Native Supabase real-time subscriptions (ready to use)
- **Zero-Container Deployment**: No Docker, no Cloud Run, just Edge Functions

### Changed

- **Architecture**: Container-based â†’ Supabase-first serverless
- **Backend**: Express.js server â†’ Supabase Edge Functions
- **Database**: Manual integration â†’ Native Supabase with RLS
- **Deployment**: Docker builds â†’ Function deployment (30 seconds vs. 5 minutes)
- **Environment**: .env files â†’ Supabase environment variables
- **Development**: Node.js â†’ TypeScript/Deno Edge Functions

### Removed
