# ProspectPro v2.0 - Iterative Testing Framework

## Overview

This branch contains the Enhanced CSV Export System v2.0 with comprehensive campaign tracking and multi-query support. This document provides testing procedures and validation steps for the new features.

## Testing Scope

### ‚úÖ Core Features Enhanced
1. **Multi-Query Campaign Support** - Build datasets across multiple searches
2. **45+ Column CSV Export** - Comprehensive business intelligence data
3. **Owner vs Company Contact Differentiation** - Enhanced contact classification
4. **Campaign Analytics** - Query-level analysis and optimization metrics
5. **Testing Support** - Rich metadata for algorithm optimization

### üîß New API Endpoints
- `POST /api/business/campaign/start` - Initialize new campaign
- `POST /api/business/campaign/add-query` - Add query to existing campaign
- `GET /api/business/campaign/status/:campaignId` - Get campaign status
- `POST /api/business/campaign/export` - Export complete campaign

## Testing Procedures

### 1. Single Query with Enhanced CSV Export

```bash
# Test basic single query functionality
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/business/discover \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "pizza restaurants",
    "location": "Austin, TX",
    "count": 5,
    "budgetLimit": 2.0,
    "qualityThreshold": 70,
    "exportToCsv": true
  }'
```

**Expected Results:**
- CSV export with 45+ columns
- Campaign ID returned for potential multi-query expansion
- Owner vs company contact differentiation
- Enhanced metadata in response

**Validation Steps:**
1. Check CSV has all expected columns (Campaign ID, Query ID, etc.)
2. Verify contact differentiation (owner email vs company email)
3. Confirm confidence scores are present and reasonable (80%+)
4. Validate source attribution for all data points

### 2. Multi-Query Campaign Workflow

#### Step 1: Start Campaign
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/business/campaign/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "campaignName": "Austin Food Scene Analysis",
    "description": "Comprehensive restaurant market research"
  }'
```

**Expected:** Campaign ID returned, ready for queries

#### Step 2: Add Multiple Queries
```bash
# Query 1: Pizza
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/business/campaign/add-query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "campaignId": "YOUR_CAMPAIGN_ID",
    "query": "pizza restaurants",
    "location": "Austin, TX",
    "count": 5,
    "qualityThreshold": 70
  }'

# Query 2: Tacos  
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/business/campaign/add-query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "campaignId": "YOUR_CAMPAIGN_ID",
    "query": "taco shops",
    "location": "Austin, TX", 
    "count": 5,
    "qualityThreshold": 70
  }'

# Query 3: BBQ
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/business/campaign/add-query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "campaignId": "YOUR_CAMPAIGN_ID",
    "query": "bbq restaurants",
    "location": "Austin, TX",
    "count": 5,
    "qualityThreshold": 70
  }'
```

**Expected:** Each query adds leads to campaign with unique query IDs

#### Step 3: Check Campaign Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/business/campaign/status/YOUR_CAMPAIGN_ID
```

**Expected:** Campaign summary with all queries and totals

#### Step 4: Export Complete Campaign
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/business/campaign/export \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"campaignId": "YOUR_CAMPAIGN_ID"}'
```

**Expected:** 
- Comprehensive CSV with all queries combined
- Campaign summary JSON file
- Analysis data JSON file
- Download URLs for all files

### 3. Enhanced Contact Differentiation Testing

Test with businesses known to have owner-operated structures:

```bash
# Test law firm (owner detection)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/business/discover \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Trevor Caudle Law Practice",
    "location": "San Francisco, CA",
    "count": 1,
    "exportToCsv": true
  }'

# Test restaurant chain (company structure)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/business/discover \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "McDonald's",
    "location": "Austin, TX", 
    "count": 3,
    "exportToCsv": true
  }'
```

**Validation Criteria:**
- Owner email should have high confidence (80%+) for law firm
- Company email should be primary for chain restaurant

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing Multi-Query Campaigns

```bash
# Test campaign with 10 queries
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/business/campaign/add-query \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "campaignId": "YOUR_CAMPAIGN_ID",
      "query": "restaurant '$i'",
      "location": "Austin, TX",
      "count": 2
    }'
  echo "Query $i completed"
  sleep 2
done
```

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Each query should complete in < 10 seconds
- Memory usage should remain stable across queries
- Campaign export should handle 50+ queries efficiently
- CSV export should complete in < 30 seconds for 100 leads
