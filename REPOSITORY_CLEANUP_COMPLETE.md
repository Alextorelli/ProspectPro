## ProspectPro v3.1.0 - Legacy System Removal Report

### Overview

Successfully removed legacy validation systems and updated all references to ensure clean integration with Enhanced Quality Scoring v3.0.

---

## 🗑️ **Files Removed**

### Legacy Validation Systems

```bash
REMOVED: /modules/validators/validation-pre-screening.js
REMOVED: /modules/validators/validation-data-comprehensive.js
```

**Impact**: These files contained outdated scoring algorithms that were replaced by Enhanced Quality Scoring v3.0. Removal prevents conflicts and confusion.

## 📝 **Files Updated**

### 1. `/modules/core/core-lead-discovery-engine.js`

```diff
- const ValidationRouter = require("../routing/validation-smart-router");
- this.validationRouter = new ValidationRouter();
+ // Removed: ValidationRouter (unused import)
+ // Updated: Enhanced Quality Scoring v3.0 integration
```

**Changes**:

- ✅ Removed unused ValidationRouter import and initialization
- ✅ Updated header comment to reference Enhanced Quality Scoring v3.0
- ✅ Maintained all functional imports (Registry engines, API clients, etc.)

### 2. `/package.json`

```diff
- "version": "3.0.0",
- "description": "Production-grade lead generation platform with zero-fake-data policy and Supabase Vault integration",
+ "version": "3.1.0",
+ "description": "Production-grade lead generation platform with Enhanced Quality Scoring v3.0, zero-fake-data policy and Supabase Vault integration",
```

**Changes**:

- ✅ Version bumped to 3.1.0
- ✅ Updated description to highlight Enhanced Quality Scoring v3.0
