## 🚀 Production Deployment

### **1. API Key Configuration**

```bash
# Add to .env file
echo "APOLLO_API_KEY=sRlHxW_zYKpcToD-tWtRVQ" >> .env
echo "HUNTER_IO_API_KEY=a8a4b8fe0c1b7b9b7e6f4f0ad61f5b8e8c4a80c1" >> .env
```

### **2. Budget Monitoring Setup**

```javascript
// Monitor daily API costs
const dailyBudgetMonitor = {
  hunter: { budget: 30, used: 0 }, // $30 Hunter.io budget
  apollo: { budget: 0, used: 0 }, // $0 Apollo budget (FREE tier)
  total: { budget: 50, used: 0 }, // $50 total daily budget
};
```

### **3. Circuit Breaker Configuration**

```javascript
// API failure protection
const circuitBreakers = {
  hunter: { threshold: 5, timeout: 300000 }, // 5 failures, 5min timeout
  apollo: { threshold: 3, timeout: 180000 }, // 3 failures, 3min timeout (FREE tier)
  patterns: { threshold: 10, timeout: 60000 }, // 10 failures, 1min timeout
