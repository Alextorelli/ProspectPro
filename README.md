## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Deploy to Railway** – Refer to the consolidated [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
2. **Configure Supabase** – Set `SUPABASE_URL` (HTTPS) + `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (preferred new format) or `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (legacy)
3. **Add API Keys** – Google Places required; others optional but recommended
4. **(Optional) Enable degraded mode** by setting `ALLOW_DEGRADED_START=true` to keep container alive while fixing DB config
5. **Access your app** at `https://your-app.railway.app`
6. **Diagnostics**: Visit `/health` (quick) or `/diag` (full) for connection analysis

## 📋 What You'll Need

### Free Accounts
- [Railway](https://railway.app) - Web hosting ($5/month after free tier)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) - PostgreSQL database (free tier: 500MB)
- [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com) - Places API

### Connection & Key Precedence
Environment variables used by the server (in order of selection for Supabase client):
1. `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (preferred new secure format: sb_secret_...)
2. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (legacy service role: eyJ... JWT format)
3. `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (fallback / reduced capability)
4. `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (last resort; limited access)

Required: `SUPABASE_URL` must be the HTTPS API root (`https://<ref>.supabase.co`).

Optional: `SUPABASE_DB_POOLER_URL` only for external raw Postgres tools — NOT used by `supabase-js`.

### API Keys (Some Free Tiers Available)
- **Google Places API** (Required) - ~$0.032 per search
- **Hunter.io** (Optional) - Email discovery, 25 free/month
- **NeverBounce** (Optional) - Email validation, 1000 free/month

## 💡 Cost Breakdown

| Service | Cost | Free Tier |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Google Places | $0.032/search + $0.017/details | $200 monthly credit |
| Railway Hosting | $5/month | Free hobby plan |
| Supabase Database | Free up to 50MB | 500MB free |
| Hunter.io | $0.04/search | 25 searches/month |
| NeverBounce | $0.008/verification | 1000 verifications/month |

**Estimated cost per qualified lead: $0.08 - $0.15**

## 🌐 Web Access & Monitoring

### Main Application
- **Lead generation interface** with industry/location filters
- **Campaign management** with real-time progress tracking
- **Export tools** for CSV/Excel download
- **Quality scoring** with confidence ratings

### Admin Dashboard
Provides cost tracking, budget alerts, quality metrics, and usage analytics.

### 📊 Enhanced Monitoring & Diagnostics

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/health` | Fast JSON status: ok / degraded / error + summary |
| `/diag` | Full Supabase diagnostics snapshot |
| `/metrics` | **NEW** Prometheus metrics for monitoring |
| `/boot-report` | **NEW** Detailed startup phase diagnostics |
| `/loop-metrics` | **NEW** Event loop performance metrics |

#### 🔍 Boot Phase Debugging
The application now includes comprehensive startup instrumentation:
- **Phase tracking** - Monitor each startup phase with timing
- **Error context** - Detailed error reporting with stack traces  
- **Performance metrics** - Startup efficiency and overhead analysis
- **Health reporting** - Real-time boot status with 75%+ success rate

#### 📈 Prometheus Metrics
Comprehensive business and infrastructure monitoring with 20+ custom metrics:
- **HTTP requests** - Response times, status codes, endpoint usage
- **Supabase operations** - Connection health, query performance, error rates
- **API costs** - Real-time cost tracking across all services
- **Business discovery** - Lead generation rates, qualification success
- **Campaign metrics** - User activity, export volumes, search patterns
- **Security events** - Rate limiting triggers, authentication attempts

#### 🛡️ Security Hardening
Enhanced security middleware protecting all endpoints:
- **Helmet security headers** - CSRF, XSS, and clickjacking protection
- **CORS policies** - Controlled cross-origin access
- **Rate limiting** - 100 requests/15min general, 10/hour for expensive operations
- **Admin authentication** - Token-based access control
- **Input validation** - Request sanitization and validation

Degraded mode allows the server to stay online for investigation when the DB is unreachable. Enable by setting `ALLOW_DEGRADED_START=true` before deploy; disable once stable.

### Degraded Mode Workflow
1. Deploy with misconfigured or pending Supabase creds + `ALLOW_DEGRADED_START=true`
2. Hit `/diag` to view: key presence, network reachability, REST auth probe, table probe
3. Correct env vars in Railway → redeploy (or just update variables and restart)
4. Once `/health` shows `status: ok`, remove `ALLOW_DEGRADED_START` for stricter future starts

### Crash Prevention Enhancements
Global handlers (`unhandledRejection`, `uncaughtException`) and a heartbeat log every 2 minutes reduce silent failures and aid log-based monitoring.
