### Phase 2: Optimization Opportunities

**Caching Optimization**:

```sql
-- Analyze cache effectiveness
SELECT
  provider,
  COUNT(*) as total_requests,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cached = true) as cache_hits,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cached = false) as cache_misses,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cached = true) / COUNT(*), 2) as hit_rate,
  SUM(cost) FILTER (WHERE cached = false) as api_costs,
  SUM(cost) as total_tracked_cost
FROM enrichment_cache
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY provider
ORDER BY api_costs DESC;

-- Identify cacheable patterns
SELECT
  business_type,
  location,
  COUNT(*) as request_count,
  AVG(confidence_score) as avg_confidence
FROM campaigns c
JOIN leads l ON l.campaign_id = c.id
WHERE c.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY business_type, location
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY request_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
````

**Cache Hit Rate Targets**:

- Google Places: Target 60% (current: [X]%)
- Hunter.io: Target 70% (current: [X]%)
- NeverBounce: Target 80% (current: [X]%)
- Overall: Target 65% (current: [X]%)

**Optimization Actions**:

1. **Extend Cache TTL**: 24h → 48h for stable data sources
2. **Implement Prefix Caching**: Cache partial location data
3. **Predictive Caching**: Pre-fetch common business types
4. **Smart Invalidation**: Only clear cache on data quality issues

**Cost Savings Projection**:

```markdown
### Cache Optimization Savings

Current state:

- Monthly API calls: 10,000
- Cache hit rate: 45%
- API costs: $500/month

Optimized state:

- Monthly API calls: 10,000
- Cache hit rate: 65%
- API costs: $325/month

**Monthly Savings: $175 (35% reduction)**
**Annual Savings: $2,100**
```

### Phase 3: Query Optimization

**Database Performance Analysis**:

```sql
-- Find slow queries
SELECT
  queryid,
  query,
  calls,
  ROUND(total_exec_time::numeric / 1000, 2) as total_time_seconds,
  ROUND(mean_exec_time::numeric, 2) as avg_time_ms,
  ROUND((total_exec_time / SUM(total_exec_time) OVER ()) * 100, 2) as percent_total_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE query NOT LIKE '%pg_stat_statements%'
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Identify missing indexes
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  attname,
  n_distinct,
  correlation
FROM pg_stats
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND n_distinct > 100
  AND correlation < 0.1
ORDER BY n_distinct DESC;
```

**Index Recommendations**:

```sql
-- High-impact index suggestions
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_leads_campaign_confidence
ON leads(campaign_id, confidence_score DESC)
WHERE confidence_score >= 70;

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_campaigns_user_status
ON campaigns(user_id, status, created_at DESC)
WHERE status IN ('completed', 'processing');

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_enrichment_cache_lookup
ON enrichment_cache(cache_key, created_at)
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '48 hours';
```

**Performance Improvement Targets**:

- Campaign list query: <50ms (current: [X]ms)
- Lead search query: <100ms (current: [X]ms)
- Export generation: <2s (current: [X]s)

### Phase 4: API Usage Optimization

**Request Batching**:

```typescript
// Batch API requests to reduce overhead
interface BatchRequest {
  businesses: string[];
  location: string;
}

async function batchGooglePlacesLookup(batch: BatchRequest): Promise<any[]> {
  // Group requests by location to maximize cache hits
  const cacheKey = `batch-${batch.location}-${batch.businesses
    .sort()
    .join(",")}`;

  // Check cache first
  const cached = await getCachedBatch(cacheKey);
  if (cached) return cached;

  // Make single API call with multiple businesses
  const results = await Promise.all(
    batch.businesses.map((business) =>
      googlePlacesSearch(`${business} in ${batch.location}`)
    )
  );

  // Cache entire batch
  await cacheBatch(cacheKey, results, 48 * 60 * 60); // 48h TTL

  return results;
}
```

**Rate Limit Optimization**:

```typescript
// Implement token bucket for rate limiting
class RateLimiter {
  private tokens: number;
  private lastRefill: number;
  private refillRate: number; // tokens per second
  private capacity: number;

  constructor(refillRate: number, capacity: number) {
    this.refillRate = refillRate;
    this.capacity = capacity;
    this.tokens = capacity;
    this.lastRefill = Date.now();
  }

  async acquire(cost: number = 1): Promise<void> {
    await this.refill();

    if (this.tokens >= cost) {
      this.tokens -= cost;
      return;
    }

    // Wait until tokens available
    const waitTime = ((cost - this.tokens) / this.refillRate) * 1000;
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, waitTime));
    await this.acquire(cost);
  }

  private async refill(): Promise<void> {
    const now = Date.now();
    const timePassed = (now - this.lastRefill) / 1000;
    const tokensToAdd = timePassed * this.refillRate;

    this.tokens = Math.min(this.capacity, this.tokens + tokensToAdd);
    this.lastRefill = now;
  }
}

// Usage: Respect API rate limits with 20% buffer
const googlePlacesLimiter = new RateLimiter(10, 100); // 10 req/s, burst 100
```

### Phase 5: Infrastructure Optimization

**Edge Function Optimization**:

```typescript
// Reduce cold start times and memory usage

// Before: Multiple imports
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts";
import { z } from "https://deno.land/x/zod@v3.21.4/mod.ts";

// After: Consolidated imports and lazy loading
import { serve } from "std/http/server.ts";

// Lazy load heavy dependencies
let supabaseClient: any = null;
function getSupabase() {
  if (!supabaseClient) {
    const { createClient } = await import("@supabase/supabase-js");
    supabaseClient = createClient(
      Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_URL")!,
      Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY")!
    );
  }
  return supabaseClient;
}
```

**Database Connection Pooling**:

```typescript
// Reuse database connections across invocations
const connectionPool = {
  client: null,
  lastUsed: 0,
  maxAge: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
};

function getConnection() {
  const now = Date.now();
  if (
    connectionPool.client &&
    now - connectionPool.lastUsed < connectionPool.maxAge
  ) {
    connectionPool.lastUsed = now;
    return connectionPool.client;
  }

  // Create new connection
  connectionPool.client = createClient(/* ... */);
  connectionPool.lastUsed = now;
  return connectionPool.client;
}
```

### Phase 6: Cost Monitoring & Alerts

**Cost Tracking Dashboard**:

```sql
-- Create cost monitoring view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW cost_analytics AS
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) as date,
  provider,
  COUNT(*) as total_requests,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cached = false) as api_calls,
  SUM(cost) FILTER (WHERE cached = false) as daily_api_cost,
  AVG(cost) as avg_cost_per_request,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cached = true) / COUNT(*), 2) as cache_hit_rate
FROM enrichment_cache
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at), provider
ORDER BY date DESC, daily_api_cost DESC;

-- Set up cost alerts
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_cost_anomalies()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
  avg_daily_cost DECIMAL;
  today_cost DECIMAL;
BEGIN
  -- Calculate average daily cost (last 7 days)
  SELECT AVG(daily_cost) INTO avg_daily_cost
  FROM (
    SELECT SUM(cost) as daily_cost
    FROM enrichment_cache
    WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
      AND created_at < CURRENT_DATE
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at)
  ) subq;

  -- Calculate today's cost so far
  SELECT SUM(cost) INTO today_cost
  FROM enrichment_cache
  WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE;

  -- Alert if today's cost > 150% of average
  IF today_cost > (avg_daily_cost * 1.5) THEN
    -- Trigger alert (send to monitoring system)
    INSERT INTO cost_alerts (alert_type, message, threshold, actual, created_at)
    VALUES (
      'cost_anomaly',
      'Daily API cost exceeds threshold',
      avg_daily_cost * 1.5,
      today_cost,
      NOW()
    );
  END IF;

  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Pre-Optimization Baseline:**

```bash
# 1. Sync Thunder Client environment
npm run thunder:env:sync

# 2. Run baseline performance tests
# Execute ProspectPro-Discovery collection 50 times
# Execute ProspectPro-Enrichment collection 50 times
# Record: response times, cache hit rates, costs

# 3. Document baseline metrics
# - Avg response time per endpoint
# - Cache hit percentage
# - Cost per request
# - Total monthly projection
```

**Post-Optimization Validation:**

```bash
# After implementing optimization changes:

# 1. Run same Thunder Client collections
# 2. Compare metrics against baseline
# 3. Validate improvements:
#    - Response time reduction
#    - Cache hit rate increase
#    - Cost per request decrease
#    - Zero regression in functionality
```

}
```

**A/B Testing for Optimization Strategies:**

```bash
# Compare optimization approaches:

# Test A: Extended cache TTL (24h → 48h)
# - Run discovery tests with 24h cache
# - Measure: cache hit rate, costs, staleness

# Test B: Extended cache TTL (24h → 48h)
# - Run discovery tests with 48h cache
# - Measure: same metrics
# - Compare: improvement vs data freshness tradeoff

# Use Thunder Client to execute identical requests
# Document results in cost analytics view
```

**Continuous Cost Monitoring:**

```bash
# Automated daily cost checks via Thunder Client:

# 1. Run cost tracking validation request
# 2. Export results to CSV
# 3. Compare against previous day
# 4. Alert if cost increase >10% day-over-day

# Script: scripts/monitoring/daily-cost-check.sh
# Executes Thunder request, parses JSON, logs trends
```

**Optimization Success Criteria:**

Validate with Thunder Client tests:

- [ ] Cache hit rate increased by 20+ percentage points
- [ ] Average response time decreased by 30%+
- [ ] Cost per request decreased by 25%+
- [ ] No functionality regressions (all existing tests pass)
- [ ] Database query performance improved (p95 <100ms)
- [ ] Zero increase in error rates

Focus on sustainable cost reduction while maintaining service quality and zero fake data policy compliance.
