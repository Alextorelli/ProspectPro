# Telemetry Cleanup Report

**Date:** 2025-10-20

## Summary

This report documents the current state of the ProspectPro repository after the removal of all legacy Thunder/Jaeger references and the migration to MCP log-forwarder and Supabase logs for observability, tracing, and validation. All automation outputs, coverage, and diagnostics are now aligned with the new directory structure and reporting standards.

---

## Directory State

- All legacy audit artifacts and status files have been removed after unwinding dependencies and updating references.
- Observability, tracing, and validation now use only MCP log-forwarder and Supabase logs.
- Automation outputs (coverage, diagnostics, context snapshots) are standardized under `reports/context/`.
- The current directory structure is compliant with the hybrid mono-repo plan (see `docs/app/REPO_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md`).

---

## Key Changes Since Last Report

- All Thunder/Jaeger references removed from code, diagrams, scripts, and documentation.
- Legacy audit artifacts (`docs-audit.txt`, `structure-gap.md`, `CODEBASE_SIZES_BEFORE.txt`, `PRODUCTION_MCP_INITIALIZED.md`) retired. This file is now the canonical coverage output.
- MCP production status snapshot migrated into `docs/tooling/devops-agent-runbook.md`.
- Copilot instructions and runbooks updated to reference live documentation and staging guardrails.
- VS Code Phase 02 task now emits coverage to `reports/context/coverage.md`.

---

## Validation

- All documentation, scripts, and automation tasks have been updated and validated.
- No remaining references to Thunder/Jaeger or legacy audit artifacts.
- All changes are documented in this report for audit and compliance.

---

## Next Steps

- Continue migration to the new directory layout as described in `REPO_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md`.
- Ensure all automation outputs remain stable through the migration.
- Deprecate `TELEMETRY_LEGACY_CLEANUP_REPORT_2025-10-20.md` and update all references to point to this report.
