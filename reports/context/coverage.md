# Telemetry Cleanup Report

**Date:** 2025-10-20

## Summary

This report documents the current state of the ProspectPro repository after the removal of all legacy Thunder/Jaeger references and the migration to MCP log-forwarder and Supabase logs for observability, tracing, and validation. All automation outputs, coverage, and diagnostics are now aligned with the new directory structure and reporting standards.

---

## Directory State

- All legacy audit artifacts and status files have been removed after unwinding dependencies and updating references.
- Observability, tracing, and validation now use only MCP log-forwarder and Supabase logs.
- Automation outputs (coverage, diagnostics, context snapshots) are standardized under `reports/context/`.
- The current directory structure is compliant with the hybrid mono-repo plan (see `docs/app/REPO_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md`).

---

## Key Changes Since Last Report

- All Thunder/Jaeger references removed from code, diagrams, scripts, and documentation.
- Legacy audit artifacts (`docs-audit.txt`, `structure-gap.md`, `CODEBASE_SIZES_BEFORE.txt`, `PRODUCTION_MCP_INITIALIZED.md`) retired. This file is now the canonical coverage output.
- MCP production status snapshot migrated into `docs/tooling/devops-agent-runbook.md`.
- Copilot instructions and runbooks updated to reference live documentation and staging guardrails.
- VS Code Phase 02 task now emits coverage to `reports/context/coverage.md`.

---

## Validation

- All documentation, scripts, and automation tasks have been updated and validated.
- No remaining references to Thunder/Jaeger or legacy audit artifacts.
- All changes are documented in this report for audit and compliance.

### Agent Integration Validation (Phase 1)

#### MCP Server Inventory

- **From config/mcp-config.json:**
  - `prospectpro-production` (production monitoring, 32 tools)
  - `prospectpro-development` (API integration/dev, 12 tools)
  - `prospectpro-troubleshooting` (debugging, 6 tools)
- **From dev-tools/mcp-servers/registry.json:**
  - `chrome-devtools` (browser automation, profiling)
  - `github` (repo management, CI/CD)
  - `supabase-troubleshooting` (log aggregation, error correlation)
  - `postgresql` (database ops, migration validation)
  - `integration-hub` (webhook, third-party integration)
- **From dev-tools/mcp-servers/README.md:**
  - Production: `production-server.js` (28 tools)
  - Development: `development-server.js` (8 tools)
  - Troubleshooting: `supabase-troubleshooting-server.js` (6 tools)

**Note:** Some naming and tool count mismatches exist between config, registry, and documentation. Registry includes additional servers (chrome-devtools, github, postgresql, integration-hub) not present in config. Tool counts differ slightly (config: 32/12/6, docs: 28/8/6). All core MCP servers are present and documented.

#### Chat Mode Manifest Inventory

- **Available in .github/chatmodes/**
  - Smart Debug.chatmode.md
  - Feature Delivery.chatmode.md
  - Production Support.chatmode.md
  - API Research.chatmode.md
  - Cost Optimization.chatmode.md
  - README.md
  - IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
  - Custom Agent Chat Modes Summary.md

**Reference:** README and summary files confirm all 5 required chat modes are present and implemented. No missing or extra chat mode manifests.

#### Code Audit: Unsafe Workspace Folder Usage

- Searched for `workspaceFolders![0]` and related patterns in all code and markdown.
- **Result:** No direct code usages found. Only references are in the integration plan markdown (for future refactor).

---

All Phase 1 integration validation steps complete. No critical gaps found. Proceed to code hardening and documentation update phases.

---

## Next Steps

- Continue migration to the new directory layout as described in `REPO_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md`.
- Ensure all automation outputs remain stable through the migration.
- Deprecate `TELEMETRY_LEGACY_CLEANUP_REPORT_2025-10-20.md` and update all references to point to this report.
