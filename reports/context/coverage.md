# Telemetry Cleanup Report

**Date:** 2025-10-20

## Summary

This report documents the current state of the ProspectPro repository after the removal of all legacy Thunder/Jaeger references and the migration to MCP log-forwarder and Supabase logs for observability, tracing, and validation. All automation outputs, coverage, and diagnostics are now aligned with the new directory structure and reporting standards.

---

## Directory State

- All legacy audit artifacts and status files have been removed after unwinding dependencies and updating references.
- Observability, tracing, and validation now use only MCP log-forwarder and Supabase logs.
- Automation outputs (coverage, diagnostics, context snapshots) are standardized under `reports/context/`.
- The current directory structure is compliant with the hybrid mono-repo plan (see `docs/app/REPO_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md`).

---

## Key Changes Since Last Report

- All Thunder/Jaeger references removed from code, diagrams, scripts, and documentation.
- Legacy audit artifacts (`docs-audit.txt`, `structure-gap.md`, `CODEBASE_SIZES_BEFORE.txt`, `PRODUCTION_MCP_INITIALIZED.md`) retired. This file is now the canonical coverage output.
- MCP production status snapshot migrated into `docs/tooling/devops-agent-runbook.md`.
- Copilot instructions and runbooks updated to reference live documentation and staging guardrails.
- VS Code Phase 02 task now emits coverage to `reports/context/coverage.md`.

---

## Validation

- All documentation, scripts, and automation tasks have been updated and validated.
- No remaining references to Thunder/Jaeger or legacy audit artifacts.
- All changes are documented in this report for audit and compliance.

### Agent Integration Validation (Phase 1)

#### MCP Server Inventory

- **From config/mcp-config.json:**
  - `prospectpro-production` (production monitoring, 32 tools)
  - `prospectpro-development` (API integration/dev, 12 tools)
  - `prospectpro-troubleshooting` (debugging, 6 tools)
- **From dev-tools/mcp-servers/registry.json:**
  - `chrome-devtools` (browser automation, profiling)
  - `github` (repo management, CI/CD)
  - `supabase-troubleshooting` (log aggregation, error correlation)
  - `postgresql` (database ops, migration validation)
  - `integration-hub` (webhook, third-party integration)
- **From dev-tools/mcp-servers/README.md:**
  - Production: `production-server.js` (28 tools)
  - Development: `development-server.js` (8 tools)
  - Troubleshooting: `supabase-troubleshooting-server.js` (6 tools)

**Note:** Some naming and tool count mismatches exist between config, registry, and documentation. Registry includes additional servers (chrome-devtools, github, postgresql, integration-hub) not present in config. Tool counts differ slightly (config: 32/12/6, docs: 28/8/6). All core MCP servers are present and documented.

#### Chat Mode Manifest Inventory

- **Available in .github/chatmodes/**
  - Smart Debug.chatmode.md
  - Feature Delivery.chatmode.md
  - Production Support.chatmode.md
  - API Research.chatmode.md
  - Cost Optimization.chatmode.md
  - README.md
  - IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
  - Custom Agent Chat Modes Summary.md

**Reference:** README and summary files confirm all 5 required chat modes are present and implemented. No missing or extra chat mode manifests.

#### Code Audit: Unsafe Workspace Folder Usage

- Searched for `workspaceFolders![0]` and related patterns in all code and markdown.
- **Result:** No direct code usages found. Only references are in the integration plan markdown (for future refactor).

---

All Phase 1 integration validation steps complete. No critical gaps found. Proceed to code hardening and documentation update phases.

---

## Next Steps

- Continue migration to the new directory layout as described in `REPO_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md`.
- Ensure all automation outputs remain stable through the migration.
- Deprecate `TELEMETRY_LEGACY_CLEANUP_REPORT_2025-10-20.md` and update all references to point to this report.

## Agent Integration Plan - Phase 5 Complete ✅

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-21

### Phase 5 Automation Deliverables Completed

1. **Documentation Assets Refreshed**

   - `npm run docs:prepare` and `npm run docs:update` executed successfully

   - Duration: ~16ms

2. **Workspace Status Regeneration**

   - New npm script `"reports:workspace-status"` added to package.json
   - Workspace snapshot generated with current git status and branch information
   - `workspace_status.md` updated with Phase 5 completion status and current workspace state

3. **Configuration Changes Staged**

   - All pending `.vscode/.github` proposals reviewed and documented in `settings-staging.md`
   - Phase 5 automation updates (script additions, status updates, archival) staged for approval
   - No live config changes applied without staging review

4. **Coverage Logging Finalized**

   - Phase 5 automation notes added to coverage.md
   - Integration plan archived to `reports/context/archive/` with timestamp
   - Complete audit trail maintained for all phases

5. **Validation Pipeline Prepared**

   - Lint, test, and database test commands ready for execution
   - Output recording prepared in workspace_status.md
   - Quality assurance suite configured for final verification

6. **Stakeholder Notification Ready**
   - Comprehensive completion summary documented
   - Links to updated files and archived artifacts prepared
   - Ready for stakeholder communication and approval

### Phase 5 Execution Summary

- **Scripts Added**: `reports:workspace-status` for automated workspace snapshots
- **Files Updated**: `package.json`, `workspace_status.md`, `settings-staging.md`, `coverage.md`
- **Files Archived**: `agent-chat-integration-plan.tmp.md` → `reports/context/archive/agent-chat-integration-plan-2025-10-21.md`
- **Validation Status**: Ready for final pipeline execution
- **Risk Assessment**: All changes low-risk, documentation-focused, with clear rollback procedures

### Final Integration Status
