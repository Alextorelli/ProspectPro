## Diagram Refactor Coverage (v2)

- All v2 diagrams and configs moved to `docs/tooling/v2/`
- ER/state diagrams reflect three-mode MCP matrix: production, development, troubleshooting
- Environment selection now config/prompt-driven (see environment-loader.v2.js)
- Registry and server scripts refactored (see dev-tools/mcp-servers/v2/registry.v2.json)
- Documentation and tests validated; ready for promotion
