# ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL: Get the Anon/Public API Key

## The Issue

Your JWT signing keys show you're using **ES256** (modern elliptic curve signing). But Edge Functions still need an **anon/public API key** for validation.

## Where to Find It

**Go to your Supabase Dashboard:**

https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sriycekxdqnesdsgwiuc/settings/api

**Look for the "Project API keys" section** - you should see:

```
anon
public
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...  (or similar JWT)
[Copy] [Show] [Generate new]
```

**OR** it might show as:

```
anon / public
sb_anon_...  (new format)
[Copy] [Show]
```

## What We Need

**Share the "anon" or "public" key** - it will be either:

- JWT format: `eyJhbGciOiJ...` (long string, ~200+ characters)
- OR new format: `sb_anon_...` (if they changed the format)

## Once You Share It

I'll run:

```bash
supabase secrets set SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="<your-anon-key>"
./test-session-auth.sh
```

And everything will work!

## Why This is Needed

Supabase Edge Functions validate incoming JWTs against the project's anon key. Without the correct anon key configured in the Edge Function environment, ALL JWT tokens (including valid anonymous user tokens) are rejected with "Invalid JWT".

Your user JWT tokens are valid and properly signed with the ES256 key you showed me. The Edge Function runtime just needs the anon key to verify them.
