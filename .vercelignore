# ProspectPro .vercelignore — Frontend Build Hygiene (2025-10-18)
#
# This file controls which files/folders are EXCLUDED from Vercel frontend builds.
# It is aligned with .gitignore and workspace hygiene goals.
#
# Rationale:
# - Only static frontend assets and required configs should be deployed
# - All backend, test, dev, and archive files must be excluded
# - node_modules is handled by Vercel automatically (do NOT ignore here)
# - Supabase Edge Functions are deployed separately
# - Redundant/legacy rules removed for clarity

# === Node Modules ===
# DO NOT ignore node_modules here — Vercel handles dependencies automatically
# If you see node_modules/* flagged by validation, check .gitignore instead

# === Workspace Hygiene ===
# All rules above are reviewed and deduplicated as of 2025-10-18
# For future changes, update both .vercelignore and .gitignore as needed
