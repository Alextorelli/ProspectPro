# Diagram Guidelines â€“ Configuration Guard

> **IMPORTANT:** All configuration changes to `.vscode/` and `.github/` are guarded. Do not edit these directories directly. Stage any proposed changes in `docs/tooling/settings-staging.md` and reference the guard in all diagrams and documentation. See TEMP_DEVOPS_AGENT_PLAN.md for the current policy.
