  COALESCE(c.current_cost, 0) as total_cost,
  CASE 
    WHEN COALESCE((c.results->>'discovered')::INTEGER, 0) > 0 
    THEN ROUND(
      COALESCE((c.results->>'qualified')::INTEGER, 0) * 100.0 /

## Grafana Time-Series Queries

### For Grafana Dashboard Panels
These queries use Grafana's `$__time()` and `$__timeFilter()` macros:

#### 11. Campaign Performance Time Series
```sql
-- For Grafana time series visualization
SELECT 
  $__time(c.created_at),
  c.name as metric,
  COALESCE((c.results->>'qualified')::INTEGER, 0) as value
FROM campaigns c 
WHERE $__timeFilter(c.created_at)
  AND c.status IN ('active', 'completed')
ORDER BY $__time(c.created_at);
```

#### 12. API Cost Time Series
```sql
-- For Grafana cost tracking over time
SELECT 
  $__time(au.created_at),
  au.service,
  SUM(au.cost) as total_cost
FROM api_usage au
WHERE $__timeFilter(au.created_at)
GROUP BY $__time(au.created_at), au.service
ORDER BY $__time(au.created_at);
```

## Usage Tips

### Query Optimization
- **Use indexes**: All queries leverage the performance indexes from the monitoring schema
- **Limit time ranges**: Use `WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'` for better performance
- **Filter early**: Apply WHERE clauses before JOINs when possible

### Customization
- **Replace time intervals**: Adjust `INTERVAL '30 days'` based on your needs
- **Modify thresholds**: Update budget limits and confidence score thresholds
- **Add filters**: Include campaign-specific or user-specific WHERE clauses

### Integration with Applications
- **API endpoints**: Use these queries in your Railway application APIs
- **Scheduled reports**: Run queries on cron jobs for automated reporting  
- **Real-time updates**: Combine with Supabase real-time subscriptions
