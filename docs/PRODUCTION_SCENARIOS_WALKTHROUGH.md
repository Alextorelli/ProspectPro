## 🔄 **Scenario 5: Development ↔ Production Switching**

### **The Situation**

You discover a quality issue in production and need to quickly switch to development for debugging.

### **Rapid Environment Switch**

```powershell
# Currently in production
# Issue: Confidence scores seem lower than expected

# 1. Switch to development environment
# Open dev container (auto-applies Vira Deepforest theme)
code .devcontainer

# 2. Use Production MCP Server for comparison
> "Compare dev/prod configurations"

🔄 Dev/Prod Configuration Comparison:
│
├─ 🏭 Production Environment:
│  ├─ Theme: Default (unchanged)
│  ├─ Port: 3100
│  ├─ Data Source: Real API calls
│  ├─ Budget Limits: Enforced ($25 default)
│  └─ Quality Threshold: 85% minimum
│
└─ 🧪 Development Environment:
   ├─ Theme: Vira Deepforest (green)
   ├─ Port: 3000 (dev container)
   ├─ Data Source: Test API keys
   ├─ Budget Limits: Relaxed ($100 default)
   └─ Quality Threshold: 70% minimum (debug mode)
```

### **Debugging Workflow**

```javascript
Development Debugging Session:
│
├─ 🔍 Issue Investigation:
│  ├─ Run same campaign with debug logging
│  ├─ Identify: Email validation scoring too strictly
│  └─ Root cause: NeverBounce confidence threshold too high
│
├─ 🔧 Solution Development:
│  ├─ Adjust email validation algorithm
│  ├─ Test with development API quotas
│  └─ Validate fix doesn't reduce actual quality
│
└─ ✅ Production Deployment:
   ├─ Update confidence calculation
   ├─ Deploy via GitHub Actions
   └─ Monitor production metrics
```
