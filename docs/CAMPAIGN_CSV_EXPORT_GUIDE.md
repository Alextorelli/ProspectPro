## Frontend Usage

### Main Interface Export

The existing "ðŸ“Š Export Campaign Data (CSV)" button now intelligently detects:

- **Recent Campaign**: Exports leads from the last search campaign
- **No Campaign**: Falls back to dashboard-wide export

### Real-Time Dashboard Export

The real-time dashboard (`/monitoring`) has a dedicated export button that exports the currently selected campaign.

### Manual JavaScript Usage

```javascript
// Export specific campaign
await prospectPro.exportCampaignLeads(campaignId, {
  minConfidence: 80,
  includeProvenance: true,
  includeUnqualified: false,
});

// Export with custom options
await prospectPro.exportCampaignLeads(campaignId, {
  minConfidence: 60, // Lower threshold
  includeProvenance: false, // Smaller file
  includeUnqualified: true, // All leads
});
```

## Export Quality Filters

### Confidence Score Filtering

- **90+**: Premium leads with full validation
- **80-89**: High-quality leads (default export threshold)
- **70-79**: Good leads with minor validation issues
- **60-69**: Acceptable leads with some missing data
- **Below 60**: Typically excluded unless `includeUnqualified=true`

### Validation Status Filtering

- **Validated**: Complete validation across all data points
- **Validating**: Validation in progress
- **Pending**: Not yet validated
- **Failed**: Validation failed (usually excluded)

## File Naming Convention

```
{Campaign_Name}_{Campaign_ID_8_chars}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.csv
```

**Examples:**

- `Local_Plumbers_San_Diego_a1b2c3d4_2025-09-21.csv`
- `Wellness_Studios_Portland_x9y8z7w6_2025-09-21.csv`

### Campaign Tracking

- Campaign IDs are captured during search operations
- Frontend tracks `lastSearchCampaignId` for intelligent export
- Real-time dashboard maintains current campaign context

## Cost and Performance

### Export Performance

- **Small campaigns** (<50 leads): ~200ms export time
- **Medium campaigns** (50-500 leads): ~500ms export time
- **Large campaigns** (500+ leads): ~1-2s export time

### API Cost Tracking

- Each exported lead includes its individual discovery/validation cost
- Total campaign cost breakdown included in export metadata
- Cost-per-lead calculations for ROI analysis

## Security and Permissions

### Authentication

- All export endpoints require valid session authentication
- Campaign access controlled by user permissions
- Export activity logged for security auditing

### Data Privacy

- Exports contain only validated, legitimate business data
