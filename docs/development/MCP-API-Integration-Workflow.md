# MCP-Powered API Integration Workflow

# Example: Integrating US Chamber of Commerce API using AI assistance

## Step 1: AI-Assisted Planning

# Open Copilot Chat in VS Code and ask:

```
Using the MCP filesystem analysis, show me the current API client architecture
and suggest the best way to integrate a US Chamber of Commerce API that provides:
- Business directory search
- Chamber membership verification
- Member contact information
```

## Step 2: AI-Powered Code Generation

# Ask Copilot:

```
Based on the existing Google Places and Foursquare API clients, generate a
US Chamber API client that follows ProspectPro's patterns:
- Same caching strategy
- Same error handling
- Same usage tracking
- Zero fake data policy compliance
```

## Step 3: MCP-Assisted Testing

# Use MCP API tools to test the new integration:

```
Test the new US Chamber API integration with:
- Basic search for "restaurants" in "New York, NY"
- Membership verification for a sample business
- Compare results with Google Places and Foursquare
```

## Step 4: AI Quality Assurance

# Ask Copilot to use MCP tools:

```
Use the filesystem MCP server to check if the new US Chamber API client
follows all ProspectPro patterns and doesn't introduce any fake data risks
```

## Step 5: Performance Analysis

# Use MCP monitoring tools:

```
Generate a performance analysis comparing API costs and response times
between Google Places, Foursquare, and the new US Chamber API
```

## Step 6: Database Integration

# Use MCP database tools to understand impact:

```
Analyze how Chamber membership data would enhance existing lead confidence
scores and suggest optimal integration points in the lead processing pipeline
```

## Development Commands for Container

# Start dev container with MCP enabled

code --folder-uri vscode-remote://dev-container+[container-config]/workspace

# Inside the container, test new API

npm run mcp:test
npm run test:api us_chamber

# Use REST client to test endpoints

# File: api-tests/chamber-api.http (created above)

# Monitor real-time with MCP

# Ask Copilot: "Show me real-time API usage stats and costs"

## AI-Enhanced Development Benefits

1. **Contextual Code Generation**: AI knows your existing patterns
2. **Real-time Quality Assurance**: AI checks for violations automatically
3. **Performance Optimization**: AI suggests cost and speed improvements
4. **Database-Aware Development**: AI understands your actual data structure
5. **Integration Testing**: AI can simulate full workflows

## Example AI Conversations

### Planning Phase:

**You**: "I need to add US Chamber API. What's the best approach?"
**AI** (with MCP): "Based on your current API clients, I recommend following the same pattern. Looking at your database, Chamber membership could boost confidence scores by 15%. Here's the implementation plan..."

### Development Phase:

**You**: "Generate the Chamber API client"
**AI** (with MCP): "Here's the client following your exact patterns. I've analyzed your existing code and included proper caching, error handling, and cost tracking..."

### Testing Phase:

**You**: "Test the new Chamber API"
**AI** (with MCP): "I'm running tests now... Results: 5 businesses found, average confidence boost of 12%, total cost $0.125. Comparing with Google Places..."

### Quality Assurance:

**You**: "Check for any issues"  
**AI** (with MCP): "Scanning your codebase... No fake data patterns detected. API client follows all ProspectPro conventions. One recommendation: add rate limiting for production use."

This workflow transforms API integration from manual coding to AI-assisted development where your assistant has full context of your business logic, data patterns, and architectural decisions.
