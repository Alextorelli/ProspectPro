## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**

1. **"API key not configured"**

   - Verify key exists in Supabase Vault
   - Check Edge Function has access to vault_decrypt_secret RPC

2. **"Cost exceeds budget"**

   - Increase maxCostPerRequest parameter
   - Use cheaper enrichment tier
   - Enable caching to reduce repeat costs

3. **"No license found"**

   - Business may not require license in that state
   - Try different business name variations
   - Fallback to PDL Company enrichment

4. **"PDL likelihood too low"**
   - Decrease minLikelihood from 8 to 6
   - Add more input parameters (website, location)
   - Use company enrichment instead of person

**Testing Commands**

```bash
# Test Business License Lookup
curl -X POST 'EDGE_FUNCTION_URL/enrichment-business-license' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer SERVICE_ROLE_KEY' \
  -d '{"action": "searchCompany", "state": "CA", "companyName": "Test Corp"}'

# Test PDL Company Enrichment
curl -X POST 'EDGE_FUNCTION_URL/enrichment-pdl' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer SERVICE_ROLE_KEY' \
  -d '{"action": "enrichCompany", "companyName": "Google", "website": "google.com"}'
```
