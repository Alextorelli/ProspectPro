## 💡 Intelligent Routing Strategy

### Progressive Enrichment Waterfall

```
PHASE 1: Free Validation (always run)
├─ Hunter.io email-count (FREE)
├─ NeverBounce syntax-check (FREE)
└─ Decision: Valid domain? → Continue

PHASE 2: License Verification ($0.03)
├─ Business License Lookup (state-based)
└─ Decision: Licensed? → Continue | No license = warning

PHASE 3: Industry Detection
├─ Detect from business type or Google Places category
└─ Route to specialized API:
    ├─ Financial Services → FINRA ($0.001)
    ├─ Healthcare → NPI Lookup ($0.03)
    ├─ Legal/Professional → License + Cobalt ($0.78)
    └─ General B2B → Standard pipeline

PHASE 4: Company Enrichment ($0.10)
├─ PDL Company Enrichment (if not financial services)
└─ Decision: High confidence (>70%)? → Continue

PHASE 5: Email Discovery ($0.034)
├─ Hunter.io domain-search
└─ Decision: Emails found? → Continue

PHASE 6: Email Verification ($0.008)
├─ NeverBounce verify (if emails found)
└─ Decision: Deliverable? → High-quality lead

PHASE 7: Person Enrichment ($0.28) - Optional
├─ Only if: confidence >70% AND high-value prospect
├─ PDL Person enrichment (decision-maker discovery)
└─ Decision: Contact found? → Premium lead

PHASE 8: Compliance Verification ($0.75) - Optional
├─ Only if: compliance tier selected
├─ Cobalt Intelligence full verification
└─ Result: AI risk score + document evidence
```

### Cost Optimization Logic

```typescript
function calculateEnrichmentCost(business, config) {
  let cost = 0;
  let confidence = 0;

  // Always: Free validation (Hunter email-count + NeverBounce syntax)
  cost += 0; // FREE

  // Tier 1: License verification
  if (business.state) {
    cost += 0.03; // Business License Lookup
    confidence += 15;
  }

  // Industry routing
  if (business.industry === "financial_services") {
    cost += 0.001; // FINRA (ultra-cheap)
    cost += 0.034; // Hunter.io
    cost += 0.008; // NeverBounce
    return { cost: 0.16, tier: "financial_services" };
  }

  // Standard: Company enrichment
  if (confidence >= 15 && cost < config.maxCost) {
    cost += 0.1; // PDL Company
    confidence += 20;
  }

  // Email discovery
  if (confidence >= 35 && cost < config.maxCost) {
    cost += 0.034; // Hunter.io
    confidence += 15;
  }

  // Email verification
  if (confidence >= 50 && cost < config.maxCost) {
    cost += 0.008; // NeverBounce
    confidence += 10;
  }

  // Stop if confidence too low (don't waste money)
  if (confidence < config.minConfidence) {
    return { cost, tier: "rejected", confidence };
  }

  // Premium: Person enrichment (only high-value)
  if (config.tier === "premium" && confidence >= 70 && cost < config.maxCost) {
    cost += 0.28; // PDL Person
    confidence += 20;
  }

  // Compliance: Full verification
  if (config.tier === "compliance" && cost < config.maxCost) {
    cost += 0.75; // Cobalt Intelligence
    confidence += 15;
  }

  return { cost, tier: determineTier(cost), confidence };
}
```
