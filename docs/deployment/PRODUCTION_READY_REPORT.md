# ProspectPro Production Initialization Complete

## ✅ Status: PRODUCTION READY & SECURITY HARDENED

ProspectPro has been successfully initialized for production with enhanced schema cache handling, Supabase Vault integration, and security-hardened database functions. The system is now running with proper error detection and recovery mechanisms.

## 🚀 Current Status

- **Server**: ✅ Running on port 3000
- **Database**: ✅ Connected (with schema cache handling)
- **Health Check**: ✅ Available at <http://localhost:3000/health>
- **Diagnostics**: ✅ Available at <http://localhost:3000/diag>
- **Environment**: ✅ Production mode with degraded startup capability

## 🔧 Schema Cache Issue Resolution

The system has been updated to handle the common Supabase PostgREST schema cache issue that occurs after database updates:

### What was the problem

- After database schema changes, Supabase's PostgREST layer caches the old schema
- This caused "table not found in schema cache" errors
- Previously, this would prevent server startup completely

### How it's now fixed

1. **Enhanced Detection**: Server detects schema cache issues automatically
2. **Degraded Mode Startup**: Server starts successfully despite cache issues
3. **Clear User Guidance**: Provides specific instructions on how to resolve
4. **Automatic Recovery**: Cache refreshes automatically over time
5. **Manual Tools**: Scripts available for immediate resolution

## 🛠️ Schema Cache Management Tools

### Automatic Resolution (Recommended)

```bash
# The server now starts successfully and provides guidance
# Wait 5-10 minutes for automatic cache refresh
```

### Manual Resolution (Immediate)

```bash
# Option 1: Force schema refresh
node scripts/force-schema-refresh.js

# Option 2: Alternative refresh method
node scripts/refresh-schema-cache.js

# Option 3: Restart server after cache refresh
pkill -f "node server.js" && npm run prod
```

### Production Dashboard Actions

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → API
3. Click "Restart API" to refresh PostgREST cache
4. Or simply wait 5-10 minutes for automatic refresh

## 🚨 Missing API Keys (Optional Services)

The following API keys are not configured but are optional for enhanced functionality:

### Government Registry APIs (Optional)

```bash
# California Secretary of State business registry
CALIFORNIA_SOS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Enhanced Location Services (Optional)

```bash
# Foursquare for additional venue verification
FOURSQUARE_SERVICE_API_KEY=your_key_here
# OR
FOURSQUARE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

**Note**: The system works perfectly without these keys. They provide additional data sources for enhanced lead quality.

## 🎯 Next Steps

2. **API endpoints active**: Business discovery and campaign export
3. **Health monitoring**: Use /health and /diag endpoints

### Schema Cache Resolution (if needed)

1. **Wait**: Cache refreshes automatically in 5-10 minutes
2. **Manual fix**: Run `node scripts/force-schema-refresh.js`
3. **Dashboard fix**: Restart API in Supabase dashboard

### Optional Enhancements

1. **Add missing API keys** in Supabase Vault for enhanced features
2. **Configure monitoring alerts** using the metrics endpoints
3. **Set up automated backups** for production data
