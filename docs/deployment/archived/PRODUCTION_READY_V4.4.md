# ProspectPro v4.4 – Production Ready Summary

**Release Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Production deployed – user-aware deduplication live

## 🎯 Overview

ProspectPro v4.4 delivers per-user campaign deduplication, deterministic campaign hashing, and billing-ready analytics without disrupting the Supabase-first architecture. Every discovery request now guarantees fresh leads for authenticated and anonymous users alike.

## 🚀 Highlights

- **Fresh Results Every Time** – `business-discovery-background` filters businesses the caller has already received by consulting the new `user_campaign_results` ledger before scoring.
- **Campaign Hashing** – A deterministic `campaign_hash` ties every campaign, lead, and dedup ledger entry together for consistent billing and auditing.
- **Usage Analytics** – Helper functions expose total campaigns, lead counts, monthly spend, and deduplication savings per user/session.
- **Test Harness** – `test-user-deduplication` exercises the hash helpers, filter function, and ledger inserts end-to-end.

## 🧱 Database Schema

Apply `database/user-deduplication-enhancement.sql` to create and secure:

- `user_campaign_results` ledger with combined `user_id` / `session_user_id` uniqueness.
- `generate_campaign_hash`, `generate_business_identifier`, `filter_already_served_businesses`, `record_served_businesses`, `get_user_usage_stats`, and cleanup helpers.
- RLS policies ensuring callers can only read/write their own dedup data.

## 🔧 Edge Function Changes

- `business-discovery-background`
  - Computes `campaignHash` per request and stores it on campaigns and metrics.
  - Filters previously delivered businesses before scoring and enrichment.
  - Records delivered leads in `user_campaign_results` after enrichment.
  - Emits `fresh_after_dedup`, `user_dedup_filtered`, `user_dedup_fresh`, and `dedup_records_inserted` in `discovery_jobs.metrics`.
- `test-user-deduplication`
  - New diagnostic function validating dedup helpers from production.

## 📊 Metrics & Billing

- `discovery_jobs.metrics`
  - New fields: `fresh_after_dedup`, `user_dedup_filtered`, `user_dedup_fresh`, `dedup_records_inserted`, `campaign_hash`.
- `get_user_usage_stats(user_id, session_user_id)`
  - Aggregates campaign counts, lead totals, costs, and dedup savings for usage-based billing dashboards.

## ✅ Deployment Checklist

1. Run `database/user-deduplication-enhancement.sql` in Supabase.
2. Deploy Edge Functions:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy business-discovery-background
   supabase functions deploy test-user-deduplication
   ```
3. Redeploy remaining discovery/enrichment/export functions if not already on v4.3.
4. Validate with:
   ```bash
   # Dedup ledger validation
   curl -X POST \
     'https://sriycekxdqnesdsgwiuc.supabase.co/functions/v1/test-user-deduplication' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer <SUPABASE_SESSION_JWT>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"action":"test_deduplication","sessionUserId":"prod-validation","businesses":[{"name":"Coffee Collective","address":"123 Brew St, Seattle, WA"}]}'
   ```
5. Confirm `discovery_jobs.metrics` reflects dedup fields and `user_campaign_results` receives inserts.

## 📝 Notes

- Anonymous users map to `session_user_id`, while authenticated users record `user_id`; both share the same dedup pipeline.
- `campaign_hash` is deterministic—identical search parameters reuse cached analytics without leaking cross-user data.
- Billing dashboards can pull `get_user_usage_stats` to enumerate total campaigns, leads, cost, and dedup savings.

**ProspectPro v4.4** makes per-user freshness a core platform guarantee while preserving the zero-fake-data promise. Ready for production lead generation. 🚀
