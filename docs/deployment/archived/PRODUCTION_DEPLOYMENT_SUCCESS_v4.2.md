## 🔧 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Authentication Flow

```
1. Anonymous User → Auto-generated Session ID → Campaign Creation
2. Sign Up/In → JWT Token → User ID Extraction → Campaign Ownership
3. Data Linking → Anonymous campaigns link to authenticated user
4. Export Access → User context validation → Authorized data export
```

### Data Model

```sql
-- Campaigns: User ownership with session fallback
campaigns (id, business_type, location, user_id, session_user_id, ...)

-- Leads: Linked to campaigns with user context
leads (id, campaign_id, business_name, user_id, session_user_id, ...)

-- Exports: Tracked with user authorization
dashboard_exports (id, campaign_id, user_id, session_user_id, ...)
```

### RLS Security

- **Authenticated Users:** Access only their `user_id` records
- **Anonymous Users:** Access only their `session_user_id` records
- **Campaign Linking:** Helper functions for user migration
- **Export Control:** User context validation for all exports

---

## 🚀 READY FOR PRODUCTION USE

### Complete User Workflows ✅

1. **Anonymous Discovery:**

   - Open app → Auto session ID → Discover businesses → Export results
   - Session preserved during browser session

2. **User Registration:**

   - Sign up → Email confirmation → Return to app → Previous sessions linked
   - Permanent campaign storage and history

3. **Authenticated Discovery:**

   - Full privacy and data isolation

4. **Export & Management:**
   - View campaigns → Select campaign → Export with user authorization
   - CSV/JSON formats with complete enrichment data

### Security & Privacy ✅

- **Data Isolation:** RLS policies prevent cross-user access
- **Session Security:** Anonymous users isolated by session ID
- **Authentication:** JWT + API key validation
- **Export Authorization:** User context required for all exports

### Performance & Scalability ✅
