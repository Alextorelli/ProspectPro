üéØ PHASE 4 COMPLETE: Advanced Functions and Procedures
üéØ PHASE 5 COMPLETE: Security and Row Level Security
‚úÖ Database setup completed successfully!
```

### Step 2: Railway Project Setup

#### 2.1 Connect GitHub Repository

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Create New Project** ‚Üí **Deploy from GitHub repo**
3. **Select ProspectPro repository**
4. **Choose main branch** for deployment (critical!)

#### 2.2 Configure Environment Variables

In your Railway project dashboard, add these environment variables:

**Required Variables:**

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_secure_token_here
```

**Optional but Recommended:**

```bash
SCRAPINGDOG_API_KEY=your_scrapingdog_key
HUNTER_IO_API_KEY=your_hunter_key
NEVERBOUNCE_API_KEY=your_neverbounce_key
```

**Webhook-Specific Variables:**

```bash
RAILWAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
ENABLE_WEBHOOK_MONITORING=true
ALLOW_DEGRADED_START=true
```

#### 2.3 Generate Personal Access Token

```bash
# Generate a secure 64-character token:
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Use this as your `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` value.

### Step 3: Railway Webhook Configuration

#### 3.1 Configure Railway Webhooks

1. **In Railway Dashboard** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
2. **Add New Webhook**:

   ```
   Webhook URL: https://your-app.railway.app/railway-webhook
   ```

3. **Select Events** (check all deployment-related events):

   - ‚úÖ `deployment.success`
   - ‚úÖ `deployment.failed`
   - ‚úÖ `deployment.crashed`
   - ‚úÖ `deployment.building`
   - ‚úÖ `deployment.queued`
   - ‚úÖ `deployment.deploying`
   - ‚úÖ `service.connected`
   - ‚úÖ `service.disconnected`

4. **Copy Webhook Secret**
   - Railway will generate a webhook secret
   - Add this as `RAILWAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable

#### 3.2 Webhook Security Configuration

The webhook endpoint includes signature verification:

```javascript
// Automatic signature verification in RailwayWebhookMonitor
verifyWebhookSignature(payload, signature) {
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', this.webhookSecret)
    .update(payload, 'utf8')
    .digest('hex');

  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature, 'hex'),
    Buffer.from(providedSignature, 'hex')
  );
}
```

### Step 4: Deploy and Verify

#### 4.1 Initial Deployment

```bash
# Ensure you're on main branch for Railway deployment
git checkout main

# Commit webhook monitoring changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add Railway webhook monitoring system"

# Push to trigger Railway deployment
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically deploy from the main branch.

#### 4.2 Verify Deployment Health

Once deployed, test the monitoring endpoints:

```bash
# Basic health check
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Enhanced diagnostics with webhook info
curl https://your-app.railway.app/diag

# Webhook-specific deployment status (requires token)
curl "https://your-app.railway.app/deployment-status?token=YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Expected health check response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "degradedMode": false,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-XX...",
  "environment": "production",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "supabase": {
    "success": true,
    "authStatus": "privileged-service-role",
    "durationMs": 45
  },
  "security": {
    "status": "hardened",
    "middlewareActive": true
  }
}
```

#### 4.3 Test Webhook Processing

Trigger a test deployment to verify webhook processing:

```bash
# Make a small change to trigger deployment
echo "# Webhook test $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test webhook processing"
git push origin main
```

Monitor Railway logs for webhook processing messages:

```
üöÇ Railway Webhook Received: deployment.building
üèóÔ∏è Build Started: {id: "...", branch: "main"}
üöÇ Railway Webhook Received: deployment.success
‚úÖ Deployment Success: {id: "...", buildTime: 42000}
üîç Validating deployment: https://your-app.railway.app
‚úÖ Health check passed: {status: "healthy"}
```

### Step 5: Monitoring Dashboard Access

#### 5.1 Deployment Status Dashboard

Access comprehensive deployment analytics:

```bash
curl "https://your-app.railway.app/deployment-status?token=YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Response includes:

```json
{
  "recentDeployments": [...],
  "failureCount": 0,
  "consecutiveFailures": 0,
  "averageBuildTime": 42000,
  "lastSuccessfulDeployment": {...},
  "systemHealth": "healthy",
  "buildMetrics": {
    "totalDeployments": 5,
    "successfulDeployments": 5,
    "successRate": 100,
    "averageSuccessfulBuildTime": 42000
  },
  "webhookStatus": {
    "configured": true,
    "lastEventReceived": "2025-01-XX...",
    "totalEventsProcessed": 15,
    "activeBuilds": 0
  }
}
```

#### 5.2 Enhanced Diagnostics

The `/diag` endpoint now includes deployment information:

```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/diag
```

Response includes deployment section:

```json
{
  "service": "ProspectPro",
  "deployment": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "recentFailures": 0,
    "averageBuildTime": 42000,
    "lastSuccess": "2025-01-XX...",
    "railwayWebhooks": {
      "configured": true,
      "eventsReceived": 15,
      "lastEventReceived": "2025-01-XX...",
      "activeBuilds": 0
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Database Analytics Access

#### 6.1 Webhook Event Logs

Query webhook events directly:

```sql
-- Recent webhook events
SELECT event_type, deployment_id, processed_at, processing_status
FROM railway_webhook_logs
ORDER BY processed_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Deployment success rate by day
SELECT * FROM deployment_analytics
WHERE deployment_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY deployment_date DESC;
```

#### 6.2 Deployment Health Analysis

Use built-in analytics functions:

```sql
-- Get comprehensive deployment health summary
SELECT get_deployment_health_summary();

-- Analyze deployment failure patterns
SELECT analyze_deployment_failures(7); -- Last 7 days
```

## üîß Development Workflow Integration

### Branch-Based Development with Webhook Monitoring

The webhook system integrates with ProspectPro's 4-branch structure:

#### Production Deployments (main branch)

```bash
# 1. Work on main branch for production changes
git checkout main
# Make changes
git commit -m "Production update"
git push origin main
# Railway automatically deploys and webhooks provide feedback
```

#### Access Development Resources

```bash
# 2. Switch to debugging branch for troubleshooting
git checkout debugging
node debug/scripts/deployment-readiness.js
node debug/scripts/validate-environment.js

# 3. Switch to testing branch for validation
git checkout testing
node tests/validation/test-webhook-processing.js

# 4. Switch to instructions branch for documentation
git checkout instructions
# Read docs/webhooks/ directory
```

### Webhook-Driven Debugging Workflow

When deployments fail, webhooks provide specific debugging steps:

**Example: Dependency Failure**

```
‚ùå Deployment Failed: Module not found error
üîß Debugging Recommendations:
   üì¶ Check package.json dependencies: npm install
   üîç Verify all imported modules exist in node_modules
   üßπ Clear npm cache: npm cache clean --force
   git checkout debugging
   node debug/scripts/deployment-readiness.js
   git checkout main
```

**Example: Database Connection Issue**

```
üí• Application Crashed: Connection refused
üöë Recovery Steps:
   üîå Database connection refused
   üîë Check SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY
   git checkout debugging && node debug/scripts/validate-environment.js
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Webhook Events Not Received

**Symptoms:**

- No webhook processing logs in Railway
- `/deployment-status` shows no recent events

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify webhook configuration**:

   ```bash
   # Check Railway webhook settings
   # URL: https://your-app.railway.app/railway-webhook
   # Events: All deployment events selected
   ```

2. **Check environment variables**:

   ```bash
   # In Railway dashboard, verify:
   RAILWAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=configured
   ENABLE_WEBHOOK_MONITORING=true
   ```

3. **Test webhook endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/railway-webhook \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"type":"test","project":{"id":"test"}}'
   ```

#### Webhook Processing Errors

**Symptoms:**

- `400` or `401` responses from webhook endpoint
- "Invalid webhook signature" errors in logs

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify webhook secret**:

   ```bash
   # Ensure RAILWAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches Railway dashboard
   # Regenerate webhook secret if necessary
   ```

2. **Check webhook payload format**:
   ```bash
   # Railway sends JSON payloads
   # ProspectPro expects specific event structure
   ```

#### Database Logging Failures

**Symptoms:**

- Webhook events processed but not logged to database
- Missing deployment analytics data

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify database schema**:

   ```bash
   # Re-run database setup
   node database/database-master-setup.js
   ```

2. **Check Supabase connection**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/diag
   # Verify database.success = true
   ```

## üìà Advanced Configuration

### Custom Webhook Event Handling

Add custom event handlers by extending `RailwayWebhookMonitor`:

```javascript
// In modules/railway-webhook-monitor.js
async handleCustomEvent(event) {
  // Custom business logic for specific events
  if (event.type === 'deployment.success') {
    // Trigger custom post-deployment tasks
    await this.validateBusinessLogic(event.deployment.url);
  }
}
```

### Database Analytics Customization

Add custom deployment metrics:

```sql
-- Custom deployment performance view
CREATE VIEW deployment_performance_summary AS
SELECT
  DATE(recorded_at) as day,
  COUNT(*) as total_deployments,
  AVG(build_time_ms) as avg_build_time,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'success') as successful,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'success')::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 1) as success_rate
FROM deployment_metrics
WHERE recorded_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(recorded_at)
ORDER BY day DESC;
```

### Monitoring Integration

Integrate with external monitoring services:

```javascript
// In RailwayWebhookMonitor class
async notifyExternalService(event) {
  if (this.failureCount >= 3) {
    // Send alert to Slack, Discord, email, etc.
    await this.sendSlackAlert(`üö® ProspectPro: ${this.failureCount} consecutive deployment failures`);
  }
}
```
