## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

### The Problem (Before)

```
User submits campaign
  ↓
Edge Function processes for 25 seconds
  ↓
TIMEOUT ❌
  ↓
Returns 0 leads
  ↓
Dashboard shows broken data
  ↓
User sees error
```

**Result**: App doesn't work. Users frustrated. No leads generated.

### The Solution (After)

```
User submits campaign
  ↓
Edge Function returns immediately (<100ms)
  ↓
User sees "Processing..." with progress bar ✅
  ↓
Background task runs (1-2 minutes)
  ↓
Real-time updates: 10% → 30% → 50% → 90% → 100%
  ↓
Shows "Campaign complete! 5 leads found" ✅
  ↓
Dashboard shows accurate data ✅
```

**Result**: Perfect user experience. Real-time feedback. Accurate leads.

## 🏗️ How It Works

### Simple Explanation

**Old way** (broken):

1. User submits campaign
2. Edge Function tries to do everything
3. Times out at 25 seconds
4. Returns incomplete data

**New way** (working):

1. User submits campaign
2. Edge Function creates "job" record
3. Returns job ID immediately
4. Background task processes everything
5. Updates job record as it progresses
6. Frontend shows live updates via Supabase Real-time

### Technical Details

Uses `EdgeRuntime.waitUntil()` to run tasks after response is sent:

```typescript
// This is the magic:
EdgeRuntime.waitUntil(
  longRunningTask() // Runs AFTER response is sent
);

return Response.json({ jobId }); // Returns immediately
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### "Invalid JWT"

→ Update anon key from Supabase Dashboard

### "Job stays pending"

→ Check Edge Function logs for API key issues

### "No leads in database"

→ Verify RLS policies with test query

### "Real-time not working"

→ Enable replication for discovery_jobs table

### "Test script fails"

→ Check NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (or VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY) is set

**Full troubleshooting**: See `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`

---

## 📊 Monitoring Dashboard

### Where to Check

**Supabase Dashboard**:

- Database → discovery_jobs (job status)
- Database → campaigns (campaign results)
- Database → leads (lead data)
- Edge Functions → Logs (execution logs)

**Vercel Dashboard**:

- Deployments (frontend status)
- Functions (if using Vercel Functions)
