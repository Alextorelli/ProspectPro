# Documentation History Archive

Use this directory to store superseded tooling docs, diagrams, and taxonomy notes after promotion to production. Each archived file should include a timestamp suffix (e.g., `devops-environment-taxonomy-2025-10-21.md`) and reference the associated coverage report entry.
