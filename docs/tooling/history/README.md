# Documentation History Archive

Use this directory to store superseded tooling docs, diagrams, and taxonomy notes after promotion to production. Each archived file should include a timestamp suffix (e.g., `devops-environment-taxonomy-2025-10-21.md`) and reference the associated coverage report entry.

## 2025-10-22 Diagram Archive

- `2025-10-22-diagram-archive/` consolidates legacy v1/v2 diagrams, context orchestration flows, and taxonomy charts superseded by the telemetry-first refresh. Reference this folder before reintroducing any retired visualization.
