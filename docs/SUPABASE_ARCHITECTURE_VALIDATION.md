# ProspectPro Supabase Architecture Validation

ProspectPro v4.3 runs entirely on Supabase Edge Functions backed by a tier-aware data model. This report validates the current production architecture.

## âœ… Validation Summary

### Database Stack â€” Hardened

- Campaign, lead, and export tables live in Supabase with Row Level Security enforcing `user_id` and `session_user_id` ownership.
- Views (`campaign_analytics`, etc.) run with `security_invoker = true` and inherit the callerâ€™s privileges.
- All production migrations are applied; diff checks (`supabase db diff --linked`) report no drift.
- Indexing and JSONB storage keep enrichment lookups under 50 ms at scale.

### Edge Functions â€” Tier-Aware

- Discovery: `business-discovery-background` (primary async pipeline), `business-discovery-optimized`, `business-discovery-user-aware` (legacy compatibility).
- Enrichment: `enrichment-orchestrator`, `enrichment-hunter`, `enrichment-neverbounce`, `enrichment-business-license`, `enrichment-pdl`.
- Export: `campaign-export-user-aware` (user scoped), `campaign-export` (service role automation).
- Diagnostics: `test-new-auth`, `test-official-auth`, `test-business-discovery`, `test-google-places`.
- All functions require Supabase session JWTs validated via the shared helper in `_shared/edge-auth.ts`.

### Deployment Tooling â€” Supabase/Vercel

- Edge Functions deploy through `supabase functions deploy <name>` with project ref `sriycekxdqnesdsgwiuc`.
- Frontend builds with `npm run build` and ships via `vercel --prod` from `/dist`.
- Secrets stay inside Supabase vault (`supabase secrets set ...`); frontend references publishable keys only.

### Monitoring & Logging â€” Consolidated

- Function telemetry pulled through `supabase logs functions --tail` during every release.
- Supabase dashboard metrics confirm <100 ms cold start and consistent throughput.
- Vercel analytics validate frontend health; no Cloud Run or container orchestration exists in the pipeline.

## ðŸš€ Readiness Checklist

- [x] Supabase schema matches repository SQL.
- [x] All production Edge Functions deployed within the last release cycle.
- [x] Supabase secrets contain Google Places, Hunter.io, NeverBounce, and Foursquare API keys.
- [x] Vercel deployment `prospect-fyhedobh1-appsmithery.vercel.app` serves the null-safe v4.3 UI bundle.
- [x] Background discovery â†’ enrichment â†’ export flow completes end-to-end using authenticated sessions.

## ðŸ“‹ Next Actions for Releases

1. Re-run `supabase functions deploy ...` for any touched functions.
2. Execute `npm run build` then `vercel --prod` from `/dist`.
3. Tail `business-discovery-background` logs while completing a test campaign.
4. Verify Supabase tables (`campaigns`, `leads`, `dashboard_exports`) reflect the new campaign.
5. Reconcile any warnings surfaced in Supabase or Vercel dashboards before announcing the deploy.

**Architecture Status: Supabase-first production infrastructure validated.**
