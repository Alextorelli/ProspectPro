- **All Critical Fields**: Phone, Website, Email must be 100% verified
- **Multi-Source Verification**: Data from at least 2 different sources

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Pre-Deployment Testing
1. **No Fake Data Test**
   - Run extraction on known query (e.g., "restaurants Austin TX")
   - Verify zero fake business names appear
   - Confirm all addresses are real, verifiable locations

2. **Website Accessibility Test**
   - Check every exported website URL
   - Confirm all return successful HTTP responses
   - Verify websites contain relevant business information

3. **Email Deliverability Test**
   - Sample 10% of exported emails
   - Run through email verification service
   - Confirm <5% bounce rate on sample

4. **Cost Accuracy Test**
   - Track actual API costs during test run
   - Compare to displayed cost estimates
   - Verify cost per lead calculations are accurate

### Validation Checks Per Business
```javascript
const validationChecks = {
  businessName: {
    notEmpty: true,
    notGeneric: true,
    fromRealSource: true
  },
  address: {
    notEmpty: true,
    notPOBox: true,
    notSequential: true,
    geocodeable: true
  },
  phone: {
    notEmpty: true,
    validFormat: true,
    notFakePattern: true,
    tenDigits: true
  },
  website: {
    notEmpty: true,
    validURL: true,
    accessible: true,
    notPlaceholder: true
  },
  email: {
    notEmpty: true,
    validFormat: true,
    deliverable: true,
    preferNonGeneric: true
  }
};
```

## üîÑ Data Pipeline Flow

### Stage 1: Discovery (Free)
1. Query Google Places API for business listings
2. Scrape Yellow Pages for supplemental data
3. Merge and deduplicate business listings
4. Pre-validate business quality (name, address patterns)
5. Only proceed with businesses scoring >70%

### Stage 2: Enrichment (Paid APIs)
1. Get detailed information from Google Places Details API
2. Scrape business websites for contact information
3. Generate email candidates using permutation patterns
4. Discover emails using Hunter.io domain search
5. Extract owner names and additional contact info

### Stage 3: Validation (Verification)
1. Validate phone numbers (format, pattern checks)
2. Verify website accessibility (HEAD requests)
3. Validate email deliverability (NeverBounce)
4. Calculate confidence scores for each business
5. Apply minimum thresholds for export qualification

### Stage 4: Export (Quality Assurance)
1. Filter businesses meeting all quality requirements
2. Include source attribution for transparency
3. Add confidence scores and validation details
4. Export only verified, complete business data
5. Provide summary with actual costs and success rates

## üìà Success Metrics

- **Website Accessibility**: 100% of exported websites return successful responses

### Cost Optimization KPIs

## üö® Error Handling Requirements

### API Failure Handling
- **Google Places API Down**: Fall back to Yellow Pages + Yelp scraping
- **Scrapingdog API Down**: Use alternative scraping methods or skip website data
- **Hunter.io API Down**: Use email permutation without verification
- **NeverBounce API Down**: Use basic email format validation

### Data Quality Failures
- **No Qualified Leads Found**: Return clear error message, never fake data
- **Low Confidence Scores**: Provide recommendations for parameter adjustment  
- **API Rate Limits Exceeded**: Implement proper queuing and retry logic
- **Validation Failures**: Log specific reasons for each validation failure

### User Experience During Failures
- **Transparent Error Messages**: Show actual API errors, not generic messages
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Recommend parameter changes for better results
- **Partial Results**: Allow export of partial batches if some leads qualify
- **Cost Refunds**: Don't charge for API calls that return unusable data

This document serves as the definitive specification for data quality standards in ProspectPro. All implementation must strictly adhere to these requirements.
