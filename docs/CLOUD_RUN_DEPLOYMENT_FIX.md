## 🎯 Cloud Run Deployment Fix Summary

**Commit:** `a479021` - Fix: Bypass Supabase Vault in Cloud Run production environment

### 🔍 **Root Cause Identified**

The Cloud Run deployment failures were caused by the environment loader attempting to access Supabase Vault even in production environments, leading to schema cache compatibility issues.

### 🛠️ **Fix Applied**

Updated `config/environment-loader.js` to:

1. **Complete Vault Bypass in Production**

   ```javascript
   // PRODUCTION/CLOUD RUN: Always use environment variables (no vault)
   if (
     process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ||
     process.env.K_SERVICE ||
     process.env.CLOUD_RUN_SERVICE ||
     process.env.GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
   ) {
     console.log(
       "☁️ Production/Cloud Run detected: using direct environment variables"
     );
     return null; // Force fallback to environment variables
   }
   ```

2. **Enhanced Environment Detection**

   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `K_SERVICE` (Cloud Run indicator)
   - `CLOUD_RUN_SERVICE`
   - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`

3. **Improved API Key Logging**
   - Reports which API keys are available from environment variables
   - Clearer degraded mode messaging
   - Better troubleshooting information

### ✅ **Deployment Improvements**

- ✅ No more vault access attempts in Cloud Run
- ✅ Direct environment variable usage (faster startup)
- ✅ Compatible with Cloud Build substitution variables
- ✅ Maintains degraded startup for webhook-only operation
- ✅ Resolves schema cache compatibility issues

### 🚀 **Current Status**

- **Git Push**: Completed to `main` branch
- **Cloud Build**: Triggered automatically
- **Expected Result**: Successful Cloud Run deployment without vault errors

### 🔧 **Environment Variables Working**

Based on your Cloud Build trigger configuration:

- `_SUPABASE_URL` → `SUPABASE_URL` ✅
- `_SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` → `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` ✅
- `_WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN` → `WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN` ✅
- `ALLOW_DEGRADED_START=true` ✅
- `NODE_ENV=production` ✅

### 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. Monitor Cloud Build logs for successful deployment
2. Test health endpoint: `https://prospectpro-184492422840.us-central1.run.app/health`
3. Verify webhook endpoints are operational
4. Add additional API keys as environment variables in Cloud Build if needed

This fix maintains your current simple environment variable approach while eliminating the vault compatibility issues that were causing deployment failures.
