# 🔍 Next Step: Check API Keys Page

## What We Learned

The Legacy JWT Secret you provided (`Vap9nalyzMKjPKf6G5vzVaE/u4PXusWBU7V8h7Cl8ImzFqR+z9KE9z0gHKG69dNuxHqEDf6XHPGWCPEUBw8r5g==`) is the **old JWT secret**.

According to your dashboard, it says:

> "Legacy JWT secret has been migrated to new JWT Signing Keys"

This means your project is now using **ES256** (the new signing keys you showed me earlier) to sign JWTs.

## The Issue

Edge Functions are rejecting JWTs because they're signed with ES256 but the Edge Function environment might be configured for the old HS256 secret.

## Next Step

**Go to the "API Keys" page** in your Supabase dashboard:

https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sriycekxdqnesdsgwiuc/settings/api

**Look for these keys:**

1. **anon / public key** - Should be a long JWT starting with `eyJhbGciOiJ...`
2. **service_role key** - Should also be a JWT

**Share the "anon" key** with me - it will be ~200-300 characters long.

This anon key should be signed with your new ES256 signing keys and will work with Edge Functions.

## Why This Matters

The anon key is what Edge Functions use to validate incoming user JWTs. If the anon key is signed with ES256 (your new signing keys), then Edge Functions will accept user JWTs that are also signed with ES256.
