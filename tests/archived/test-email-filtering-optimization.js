/**
 * Test Email Filtering Optimization - Pattern vs Verified Sources
 *
 * This script validates the new email qualification logic that requires
 * verified emails (Hunter/Apollo/website scraped) for qualification,
 * treating pattern-generated emails as unverified candidates only.
 *
 * Test scenarios:
 * 1. Business with pattern-generated email only -> Should NOT qualify
 * 2. Business with Hunter.io verified email -> Should qualify
 * 3. Business with Apollo verified email -> Should qualify
 * 4. Business with website-scraped email -> Should qualify
 * 5. Business with NeverBounce deliverable email -> Should qualify
 * 6. Mixed source business (pattern + verified) -> Should qualify with verified
