## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. 🗄️ Database Setup (Supabase)

```sql
-- 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
-- 2. Copy and execute: database/enhanced-supabase-schema.sql
-- 3. Verify tables created:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('campaigns', 'enhanced_leads', 'users');

-- 4. Enable Row Level Security (if not auto-enabled)
ALTER TABLE campaigns ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE enhanced_leads ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### 2. 🚂 Railway Deployment

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and initialize
railway login
railway init

# Deploy with configuration
railway up

# Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
# Or via CLI:
railway variables set SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
railway variables set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="sb_secret_your_key"
railway variables set GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY="your_google_key"
railway variables set PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_token"
```

### 3. 🔍 Verification & Testing

```bash
# 1. Check health endpoint
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# 2. Test admin dashboard (replace with your token)
https://your-app.railway.app/admin-dashboard.html?token=your_token

# 3. Test lead discovery API
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/discover-businesses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"industry": "restaurant", "location": "New York", "count": 5}'

# 4. Monitor Railway logs
railway logs
```
