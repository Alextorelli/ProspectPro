# Railway Deployment Configuration and Troubleshooting
# =======================================================

## Current Issue Analysis
Railway deployment is failing with module import error: `Cannot find module './prospectpro-metrics-client'`

## Root Cause
The error suggests Railway's Node.js environment has different module resolution behavior than local development.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Robust Import Pattern
Modified `api/dashboard-export.js` to use fallback import strategy:
```javascript
// Try relative path first (development)
ProspectProMetricsClient = require('../modules/api-clients/prospectpro-metrics-client');

// Fallback to absolute path (production/Railway)
const absolutePath = path.resolve(__dirname, '..', 'modules', 'api-clients', 'prospectpro-metrics-client');
ProspectProMetricsClient = require(absolutePath);
```

### 2. Railway Environment Variables
Confirmed all required environment variables are present:
- ✅ SUPABASE_URL
- ✅ SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  
- ✅ GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY
- ✅ SCRAPINGDOG_API_KEY
- ✅ HUNTER_IO_API_KEY
- ✅ NEVERBOUNCE_API_KEY
- ✅ NODE_ENV=production
- ✅ PORT=3000

### 3. Package.json Optimization
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "build": "echo 'No build step required'",
    "railway:check": "node debug-railway-imports.js"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Railway Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Railway CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Deploy from current directory
railway up
```

### Option 2: GitHub Integration
1. Push changes to GitHub repository
2. Connect Railway to GitHub repo
3. Railway will auto-deploy on push

## Monitoring Dashboard Access
Once deployed, monitoring will be available at:
```
https://your-railway-app.railway.app/monitoring
```

## Troubleshooting Commands

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test all imports
node debug-railway-imports.js

# Test server startup
npm start

# Test monitoring dashboard
curl http://localhost:3000/monitoring
```

### Railway Logs
```bash
# View deployment logs
railway logs

# View live logs
railway logs --follow

# Check service status
railway status
```

## Common Railway Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Module Resolution
**Error**: `Cannot find module './prospectpro-metrics-client'`
**Solution**: ✅ Applied robust import pattern with fallback

### Issue 2: Environment Variables
**Error**: Missing API keys or database connection
**Solution**: Verify all variables are set in Railway dashboard

### Issue 3: Node.js Version
**Error**: Incompatible Node.js version
**Solution**: Add `engines` field to package.json

### Issue 4: File Case Sensitivity
**Error**: Module not found (Linux vs Windows)
**Solution**: Ensure consistent file naming and path case

## Success Indicators
✅ Server starts without import errors
✅ Database connection successful  
✅ API keys validated
✅ Monitoring dashboard loads
✅ All endpoints respond correctly

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment
1. Test monitoring dashboard functionality
2. Verify API integrations work in production
3. Test lead discovery and export features
4. Monitor costs and performance
5. Update documentation with production URLs
