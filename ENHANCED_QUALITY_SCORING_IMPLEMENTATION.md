## üî¨ **Validation Results**

### **Test Scenario: Coffee Shop Discovery**

```bash
Input: 4 businesses (high-quality to low-quality range)
Processing Time: <1 second
Total Cost: $0.150 (vs $6.00 traditional)
Cost Savings: $5.85 (97.5% reduction)
```

### **Quality Distribution**

- **High Quality (70%+)**: 50% of processed businesses
- **Medium Quality (40-69%)**: 0% of processed businesses
- **Low Quality (<40%)**: 50% of processed businesses (cost-efficient early exit)
